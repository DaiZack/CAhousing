"The 
Canadian Real Estate Association
 cut its sales forecast for this year and next on Monday as it reported slower sales for November in the wake of tighter lending rules that came into force in the summer.
The association now expects home sales this year to slip 0.5 per cent compared with 2011 to about 456,300. A forecast in September called for sales this year to rise 1.9 per cent to 466,900 units.
CREA also said it now expects sales next year to drop two per cent to 447,400 compared with earlier expectations for a drop of 1.9 per cent to 457,800 in 2013.
""Annual sales in 2012 reflect a stronger profile prior to recent mortgage rule changes followed by weaker activity following their implementation,"" Gregory Klump, CREA's chief economist, said.
""By contrast, forecast sales in 2013 reflect an improvement from levels this summer in the immediate wake of mortgage rule changes. Even so, sales in most provinces next year are expected to remain down from levels posted prior to the most recent changes to mortgage regulations.""
Finance Minister Jim Flaherty moved in July to tighten mortgage rules for the fourth time in as many years to discourage Canadians from taking on too much debt. Among the changes, Flaherty made mortgage payments more expensive by dropping the maximum amortization period to 25 years.
However, the minister said that while the tighter rules had some influence, they weren't the only cause.
""The 
Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions
 has tightened guidelines as well, and I think there's an increasing awareness among the Canadian public that excessive debt is unwise in a time of historically low interest rates,"" Flaherty said Monday.
""Interest rates only have one way to go and that is up, and eventually they will go up so people ought to be prudent in the amount of debt they take on at low interest rates.""
CREA said the average price for 2012 is expected to be $363,900, up 0.3 per cent, compared with a September forecast of $365,000, up 0.6 per cent. For 2013, CREA said it expects prices to gain 0.3 per cent to an average of $365,100. That compared with earlier expectations of a drop of one-tenth of one per cent to $364,500 in 2013.
The downgrade for the outlook for the year came as home sales edged down 1.7 per cent month over month in November and were back where they stood in August. The decrease followed a drop of about one-tenth of a per cent in September.
BMO deputy chief economist Doug Porter said for all the attention it has received, the market's performance has been far from exciting this year.
""It increasingly looks like most major markets are indeed under-going a policy-induced correction,"" Porter wrote in a note to clients.
""But, for now, the landing looks to be soft in most cities, with the rather obvious exception of Vancouver.""
However, economist David Ma-dani of Capital Economics said the belief that the Canadian market was enjoying a ""soft landing"" because prices have not fallen sharply was misplaced.
""The continued decline in existing home sales supports our view that a potentially severe housing correction is underway,"" Madani said.
""Assuming that sales continue to trend lower heading into next year, then sharper demand-and-supply imbalances will eventually lead to widespread home price declines. We still think that house prices will decline by 25 per cent over the next year or two.""
Actual, or non-seasonally adjusted, sales were down 11.9 per cent from November 2011, while the national average home price in November was $356,687, off 0.8 per cent from November 2011.
Sales were down on a year-over-year basis in three of every four local markets in November, including most large urban centres. Calgary stood out as an exception, with sales up 10.6 per cent from a year ago.
Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver contributed most to the small decline at the national level.",Canadian home sales expected to fall in 2012-13,b,1
"National home sales are projected to fall to a near-decade low in 2019, as rising interest rates and strict mortgage stress-test rules continue to put a damper on homebuyer sentiment, according to the 
Canadian Real Estate Association
 .
The group, which represents more than 125,000 realtors, is projecting that home sales across the country will decline to the lowest point in nine years but stay little changed from 2018, falling only by 0.5 per cent to 456,200 units.
CREA is projecting that the national average price for a home sold through its multiple-listing service system will rise 1.7 per cent to $496,800 in 2019.
The association forecasts a rebound in sales activity in Ontario and continuing gains in Quebec. Sales were anticipated to fall next year in Alberta and British Columbia.
""In 2019, home sales activity and prices are expected to be held in check by recent policy changes from different levels of government, in addition to additional interest rate increases,"" the group said in a forecast released Monday.
CREA has also revised down its projections for 2018, now saying that it expects national home sales will decline by 11.2 per cent to 458,200 units in 2018 - the lowest level in five years.
The group says B.C. and Ontario will make up the majority of this year's decline, while sales in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Newfoundland and Labrador will also fall to multi-year lows.
""The national forecast has been revised lower ... as an anticipated rebound in sales in British Columbia has so far failed to materialize, the recovery in Ontario sales this summer has now run its course and sales activity in Alberta has edged lower. These developments were partially offset by stronger-thanexpected sales activity in Quebec,"" it said in the report.
The association noted that sales in Quebec and in the Maritimes, particularly New Brunswick, were still anticipated to remain ""historically strong.""
National average home prices were slated to end this year down 4.2 per cent to $488,600 from 2017.
CREA attributed 2018's price drop to a 2.6 per cent year over year decline in Ontario as fewer higherprice homes were put up for sale in Toronto, especially during the spring market, which often sees a price surge.
In Toronto, the decline in average home prices this year is stark in contrast because the housing market in Canada's largest city had been ""unusually strong"" in 2017.
""As we look to 2019, the major battle lines seem fairly clearly drawn, with the market still supported by strong population growth on the one side, and challenging affordability (past price gains and rate rises) on the other,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Economics in an analyst note.
""While we expect sales activity to stabilize next year ... we nevertheless anticipate that prices will slow even further to gains likely below that of inflation.""
Porter also pointed out that there were a lot of variances regionally in relation to average sales and prices.
For instance, the housing market in Ontario's medium-sized cities continued to show strength, with both London and Windsor, Ont., posting double-digit gains in 2018. While smaller cities in Ontario, Quebec and Maritimes registered price gains that put that in a ""healthy"" balanced market.
Oil price declines have also wreaked havoc on housing prices in Western Canada, while the largest sales decline this year was in B.C., which has largely been attributed an increase in the foreignbuyers' tax.
Meanwhile, in separate release of monthly sales data, CREA reported that home sales across the country fell for a third month in a row in November, as two of what had been the hottest markets, the Greater Toronto Area and the Greater Vancouver Area, reported lower activity.
Canadian home sales through its multiple listing service system dropped by 2.3 per cent last month compared with October as the number of transactions fell in more than half of all local markets.
Sales were down year over year in three-quarters of all local markets including the GTA, Hamilton-Burlington, Ont., region, B.C.'s Lower Mainland and Calgary.
CREA says the number of new listings also saw a decline, falling 3.3 per cent in November.
The drop came as the average price for a home sold last month dropped to $488,000, down 2.9 per cent compared with the same month a year ago. Excluding the Greater Toronto Area and the Greater Vancouver area, the average price of a sold home was just under $378,000.
""The decline in home ownership affordability caused by this year's new mortgage stress-test remains very much in evidence,"" said Gregory Klump , CREA's chief economist in a statement.
""Despite supportive economic and demographic fundamentals, national home sales have begun trending lower. While national home sales were anticipated to recover in the wake of a large drop in activity earlier this year due to the introduction of the stress-test, the rebound appears to have run its course.""","Home sales forecasted to fall to nine-year low in 2019, CREA says",c,1
"A flood of buyers and sellers looking to close deals late last year ahead of looming tighter mortgage rules resulted in a 14.5 per cent ""payback"" drop in home sales between December and January, market watchers said Thursday.
Economists expected the drastic decline, which marked the lowest sales level in three years, and anticipate the market will continue to be dampened in the near future as Canadians negotiate the new rules and a January interest rates hike, the third in the past year.
""It's the biggest monthly percentage drop in sales activity since October 2008,"" said Gregory Klump, the Canadian Real Estate Association's chief economist, referring to when the country was in the midst of the so-called Great Recession.
January activity was down in three-quarters of all local markets and virtually all major urban areas, especially in Ontario's hot spot in the Greater Golden Horseshoe, according to data released by CREA Thursday. The decline was less significant on an annual basis, with sales falling 2.4 per cent.
The monthly decline ""is largely payback"" for buyers rushing to sign deals in the last three months of the year, ahead of the new rules, said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, in a note.
CREA's figures showed sales climbed to a record monthly high in December - just before the federal banking regulator's tougher rules for uninsured mortgages took effect. Starting Jan. 1, borrowers with a more than 20 per cent down payment must pass a stress test proving that they can service mortgage at a qualifying rate of the greater of the contractual mortgage rate plus two percentage point or the fiveyear benchmark rate published by the 
Bank of Canada
.
The January market also dampened due to the 
Bank of Canada
's decision to raise interest rates to 1.25 per cent, up from one per cent. The central bank's interest rate increase impacts variable rate mortgage holders, but those who opt for fixed mortgages also saw a rise in the five-year fixed rate amid rising bond yields and a stronger economy.
CREA noted that January home sales are on par with the 10-year monthly average and that a large decline in new listings of 21.6 per cent prevented the market balance from shifting in favour of homebuyers. The average price of a home rose by 2.3 per cent when compared with last year at just over $481,500.
The number of newly listed homes was at the lowest level since spring 2009. About 85 per cent of all markets had fewer listings. The Greater Toronto Area led the decline, with large percentage drops also in B.C.'s Lower Mainland, Vancouver Island and the Okanagan region, as well as parts of Ontario.
Supply restraint may have played a big part in the month's slowdown, Robert Hogue, senior economist with RBC Economics, wrote in a note. The drop in new listings hints at two psychological effects at play, he said. Many sellers rushed to list their properties in the months before Jan. 1 and, once the new rules came in, potential sellers may have feared a significant buyer pullback and waited to list.
He expects more listings to surface once those fears subside.
The market likely over-reacted to the new mortgage rules, Hogue wrote, and while homebuyer demand will remained dampened, it won't be to the extent implied by January's figures.
Volatility is expected to continue in the near-term, wrote Michael Dolega, a senior economist with TD Economics, in a note.
But, Dolega said ""some stabilization"" should occur by the middle of the year.
""Thereafter we expect activity to remain weighed down by rising interest rates, but with markets largely in balanced territory prices should remain well supported,"" he said.","Home sales in Canada fall to lowest level in three years: CREA; Every urban region sees January decline as buyers adjust to new rules, rates hike",m,1
"It's old news that it's expensive to live in Vancouver, where splashy headlines about terrible housing affordability are the norm.
With a provincial election approaching, The Vancouver Sun surveyed experts for ideas about what a new government could do to make housing more affordable. The Sun also asked political parties what they would do if elected.
The first thing a new government could do to help families with housing would be to extend parental leave to 18 months and build child care spaces that cost no more than $10 per day, according to University of B.C. policy professor Paul Kershaw.
Kershaw, who researches the financial challenges facing young families, said this would save a typical family about $50,000 before their children reach the age of six, which would make it easier for parents to save for a down payment and handle B.C.'s high housing prices or afford to pay their rent.
Kershaw said governments have few ways to influence the price of housing - which is usually determined by market forces - other than programs to fight homelessness and rental assistance to help low-income people.
""Problem is, the vast majority of younger generations face housing prices that are up 150 per cent, while wages are down $4 an hour (since 1976, on an inflation-adjusted basis). So, we need to broaden our thinking to find policy that can support most in the entire generation,"" he said. ""And right now it costs the typical couple around $15,000 from their after-tax income to share a year at home with a new baby, and it costs more than university tuition to pay for child care services, if they can find them.
""We can make it far less difficult for people to deal with higher rents and mortgages if we don't saddle them with these extra costs when they start their families.""
Meanwhile, the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver has launched a campaign to encourage the party that wins the election to reduce the property transfer tax, which was brought in in 1987 to add one per cent on the first $200,000 of a home's purchase price and two per cent on the rest. When the tax was introduced, just five per cent of homes sold for more than $200,000. The REBGV would like to see the threshold raised to $525,000 to reflect the rise in house prices over time.
""The PTT is structured to reflect home prices in the 1980s, not the prices home buyers pay today,"" said Sandra Wyant, REBGV president. ""The fact that it hasn't been adjusted in 26 years is simply not fair to home buyers and the candidates in this year's election should address this issue.""
The PTT annually generates $780 million for the provincial government, the real estate board said.
One way the NDP would address housing affordability if elected is by addressing inequality, said Joe Trasolini, Port Moody-Coquitlam MLA and NDP critic for housing.
""There's no question that affordability of housing is a problem facing British Columbians, and it is particularly acute for the Lower Mainland, which is one of the worst areas in Canada,"" Trasolini said. ""(NDP leader) Adrian Dix has been very clear that we need to address the inequality gap and you start addressing it by providing an opportunity to all young British Columbians to receive the post-secondary training and skills training that are needed to fill the jobs.""
Trasolini said that if elected, the NDP would re-introduce a minimum tax on financial institutions, and that some of the revenue would go toward supporting post-secondary education and skills development through the province through forgivable grants for students.
The NDP has also announced that if elected, it will build 1,500 units of affordable housing for low-and middle-income people, leveraging a $250 million housing endowment fund and using partnerships with other levels of government and organizations, Trasolini said.
Trasolini also suggested that there are opportunities for building more affordable housing on government land that could be leased instead of sold. One example is a property at Cambie Street and West 57th Avenue - the old site of the Pearson Hospital - where there are 25 acres. In its 2013 budget, the Liberal government announced plans to sell a portion of the site and use the proceeds to develop new health care facilities.
""Wouldn't it be a much more sound idea to retain the ownership in public hands, upzone it for the highest and best use with the co-operation of the city of Vancouver, then make the land available as a leased land to a developer or a pension fund ... to build a variety of housing choices including social housing?"" Trasolini suggested, adding that he has been involved with a similar project as the mayor of Port Moody.
""I'm not talking about something that is not done - it is done throughout the province and is very valuable,"" he said. ""You would expand the social housing base, get revenues in the provincial coffers for the lease and that revenue could be used to increase social housing elsewhere. All of a sudden you are creating some synergy and addressing the province. Instead, they're going to sell it for one-time revenue.""
Rich Coleman, minister responsible for housing and Liberal MLA for the riding of Fort Langley-Aldergrove, said the government is addressing housing affordability through homelessness programs, programs for seniors and the rental assistance program, all of which the Liberal party would continue if elected. Coleman said 40,000 B.C. families use the rental assistance program, which benefits families with annual incomes under $35,000, while the province also has 80,000 social housing units where 30 per cent of income goes toward rents.
The leader of the Green party of B.C., Jane Sterk, said the party proposes that one per cent of the provincial budget be dedicated to a housing rental pool available for market and below-market rentals.
""We haven't really created a dedicated pool of rental housing in the last 30 years in Canada or British Columbia,"" Sterk said, adding that the Green party would work with both municipal and federal governments to build this pool of rental housing.
She said the Green party also has strategies in place to encourage people to live and work in their own neighbourhood, which reduces transportation bills to free up money for housing costs. One example is pay-as-you-go car insurance, which would mean lower premiums for those who drive fewer kilometres, Sterk said.
""The other strategies that are related to working close to where you live are some of the transportation-demand management strategies that we support like road pricing, parking pricing or congestion pricing. Things like that tend to be a benefit to people who move out of single-occupancy vehicles into public transit, or who live and work close to home,"" Sterk said.
The B.C. Conservative Party did not respond to requests for an interview on this topic.

"Kris Klaasen has been ""gobsmacked"" by Metro Vancouver's housing turmoil.
While many worry the city's bubble might be bursting, the 61-year-old communications designer is conflicted over how his modest Vancouver home has become worth almost 20 times what he bought it for.
""Housing has become a hypercommodity in this city. Living in Vancouver has become very tense. And intense. Every day I'm in a conversation about the price of housing and what it's doing to the city.""
Years after Metro Vancouver became one of the world's most unaffordable cities for housing, the provincial government stunned British Columbians on July 25, announcing it would be slapping a 15 per cent tax on foreign buyers of Metro homes, from massive detached houses to modest condominiums (but not to pre-sale condos).
This seismic policy shift came in the wake of real estate industry leaders and B.C. politicians long denying that offshore investment had anything to do with affordability.
Klaasen, the ostensible beneficiary of runaway real-estate prices, bought his corner house in Kitsilano in 1982. With help from parents, he picked up the modest bungalow for $126,000.
Now realtors tell him it could sell for more than $2.4 million.
Although Klaasen recognizes he stands to haul in a big profit, he grieves over how ""outside money"" is hurting so many others in Metro Vancouver. Many who leave are young adults; others are retired. They're moving to Maple Ridge, Prince George or Vancouver Island.
""My friends are saying, 'I'm out of here,' "" he says.
'HORDES MYTHOLOGY'
The B.C. Liberals' decision, which took effect Aug. 2, to cool Metro's market by levying a 15 per cent tax on foreign buyers amounted to a startling about-face.
It was announced just one year after B.C. Housing Minister Rich Coleman claimed his government ""does not have any policy"" on foreign buyers. Coleman had argued Metro prices ""were pretty reasonable compared to other cities like London, Singapore, Tokyo."" The tax was also introduced well after Cameron Muir, chief economist for the B.C. Real Estate Association, routinely dismissed polls showing Metro residents believing there was too much foreign ownership.
""The mythology,"" Muir said in 2014, ""is that there are hordes of investors coming in Vancouver and driving up prices.""
In the face of resistance from the development industry, which in recent years has donated $12 million to the B.C. Liberals and frequently dismissed critics as ""xenophobic,"" how did Metro get to a tax on foreign buyers?
UBC geographer David Ley, author of Millionaire Migrants: Transpacific Life Lines, says the B.C. Liberals' 15 per cent tax was ""out of character"" and "" totally unexpected.""
Now for the first time in decades, Ley said, the anti-red tape B.C. Liberals took a stand for ""re-regulation"" and ""anti-globalization."" Ley, who has long tracked house prices in Metro and other ""gateway"" cities, feels the B.C. government finally felt political pressure to react to the ""collateral damage"" it has been instrumental in creating by relentlessly wooing Asian-Pacific investors after Vancouver's Expo 86 world's fair.
The tax, which does not apply to commercial property, is proving highly popular in the city of 2.5 million, which suits a governing Liberal party just eight months out from a provincial election.
The Angus Reid Institute found nine of 10 city dwellers applaud it. After announcing the tax, Premier Christy Clark's dismal approval rating jumped seven percentage points, to 34 per cent.
Vancouver's tax on foreign buyers is also catching on in the Greater Toronto Area, where Angus Reid found three of four in that region of six million want it.
Is the levy working? It's too early for firm conclusions, but the Greater Vancouver Real Estate Board's report for September contained a chart showing the average price of a detached home had plunged about $400,000 from its peak of $1.9 million.
The total number of home sales fell by about one-third in September, compared with the same month last year.
But the GVREB claims the typical ""benchmark price"" has remained firm.
Many observers question the GVREB's analysis, suggesting the industry has a vested interest in making people believe the bubble is not bursting.
SOCIAL COSTS
Why did B.C. finally feel the pressure to follow Hong Kong and Singapore, which have long had regulations to soften the deluge of East Asian capital?
The short answer is that runaway house prices have caused devastation and voter outrage.
Here is Ley's partial list of the social costs: ""Out-migration of young, difficulty in retaining key employees, overcrowding, homelessness and couch surfing, heavy debt loads, long commutes and traffic congestion, the necessary rise of illegal suites in detached homes, and young adults remaining in the family home into their late 20s. Family reproduction is also affected as the necessity of two wage earners in a family delays or prohibits childraising.""
At a recent SFU symposium, Mapping the Hedge City: Vancouver and Global Capital, Ley explained it was basically a handful of investigative journalists in Metro who forced the B.C. government, and Ottawa, to finally act.
Their articles revealed the tax necessary to rein in foreign speculation, and that more measures

FROM THE '70S TO NOW This is not the first time Metro
$1.47M residents have fretted about house prices.
The problems can be traced back to at least 1976, when Vancouver economic researcher Gordon Soule put together a book titled
$730 The Housing Crisis.
$529
In the book, then-Vancouver mayor Art Phillips and future B.C. premiers Mike Harcourt and Bill Vander Zalm discuss even then how Canada's unusually high offshore 1980 1990 2000 2010 immigration rates were fuelling relative unaffordability in Metro.
But in-migration has continued apace. And an early factor behind the rising flood of money into Metro has been the way the B.C. government sold offthe Expo 86 lands. Bypassing an offer from local buyers, Ley said Social Credit politicians sold the prime waterfront property to Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing. It was a signal for more Asian speculators to follow.
Prices would take offdramatically with the arrival of Hong Kong residents fearful of China's gaining sovereignty over their region in 1997.
Left-wing community organizers responded by protesting the razing of houses and trees and increased prices caused by the influx of money from people from Hong Kong (and Taiwan), many of whom continued to work in Asia.
Real-estate industry officials in the '90s responded by denouncing the protesters as ""racist.""
The rapid sell-offof Metro real estate in the past three decades has been exacerbated, Ley says, by scores of taxpayer-funded trade missions that federal and provincial politicians have proudly led to Asia.
Their marketing efforts came to a head last fall, when Premier Clark included three real estate firms in what turned out to be a controversial mission to China, with Vancouver NDP MLA and housing critic David Eby describing the move as ""mind-boggling.""
During all this time, however, the most crucial factor driving up Metro housing prices has arguably been Ottawa's Business Immigration Program (BIP), which was initiated in the mid-1980s.
Ley estimates the BIP has brought more than 400,000 welloff immigrants to Metro.
BIP has helped make Metro one of the most sought-after markets in the world for the $52 billion each year that Chinese buyers now spend on overseas property, Ley said.
Josh Gordon, a Simon Fraser University assistant professor of public policy, says 
National Bank of Canada
 economists estimate ""almost $13 billion was spent by Chinese investors in Vancouver in 2015 alone. This represents roughly one-third of all home sales volume in that year.""
The Conservative government eventually confessed that, as a group, those who took advantage of the BIP, many of whom own Vancouver mansions, paid the lowest amount of taxes in Canada.
The Conservatives finally killed the BIP in 2014. But the federal Liberals are considering whether to revive an immigrant investor pilot program similar to the discredited BIP.
$9,000 HOUSE IN 1948 The history of housing prices in Vancouver reveals the city has always been somewhat pricey compared to wages. But the gap grew wide in the 1990s and has become a chasm since 2010.
Earning a modest income running his business from his basement, Klaasen knows his family has only got by largely because he was able to buy his house for $126,000 more than three decades ago.
A land title search of Klaasen's property and house, which was originally built in the 1940s, shows that before he bought it, it had been cheaper still.
Previous buyers had snapped up his home for $13,800 in 1965, $15,000 in 1960 and $9,000 in 1948.
What does this mean in today's dollars? Since Klaasen's purchase in 1982, inflation in Metro has gone up 132 per cent.
That means he bought his home for roughly the equivalent of about $300,000 today.
Many people would kill for the chance to buy a house for that price.


Statistics Canada
 data suggests Klaasen bought when the ratio of average Metro earnings to average house prices was about 3.5 to one, which is considered barely affordable.
But that's a far cry from today's catastrophic ratio of 13 to one.
Klaasen realizes he is among thousands of Metro residents who are basically like lottery winners - they've become wealthy for just sitting on their ass(ets).
RISE OF AN UNEQUAL CITY
In 2016, U.S.-based Demographia, which measures house prices against wages, ranked Metro Vancouver as the third-least affordable of 367 global cities. Only Hong Kong and Sydney are worse.
SFU's Gordon is among those who say unaffordability is the leading social-justice issue in ""unequal"" Metro Vancouver. Compared to the rest of Canada, Gordon found Metro's unaffordability rate this year is 2.5 times worse than the national average.
It's also almost twice as unaffordable as the Greater Toronto Area, which also faces a housing crunch. And it's roughly five times worse than Edmonton and Ottawa, the latter being where (out-of-touch?) federal politicians are responsible for a national housing strategy.
Even though the 15 per cent tax is ""several years too late,"" Gordon said it's one necessary component to bring local housing back in line with the labour market.
In addition to combating foreign buying, the SFU professor believes the surcharge signals further policy action to come, which should discourage speculation. Similar surcharges in Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore (which has 15 related regulations) have been effective.
Unfortunately, Gordon said the tax will not stem the foreign-rooted buying that occurs through ""local proxies,"" including tax-avoiding Canadian-based shell companies, as well as offspring and spouses who may be landed residents.
Nor will it curtail purchases by ""newly arrived, non-working permanent residents with substantial (offshore) wealth.""
The other thing the 15 per cent tax does not confront is perennially shoddy law enforcement.
Many experts have cried out about the lax approaches of the federal immigration and tax departments. Reports reveal federal officials have looked the other way as money laundering and tax evasion spins out of control in Vancouver and Toronto real estate. At least governments are starting to face reality, though, Gordon says. No one should be led astray, he says, by development industry arguments that housing price jumps are caused mostly by low interest rates, the ""desirability of Vancouver,"" its allegedly ""strong"" economy, geographic constraints, bad zoning or lack of social housing. The main problem, his research shows, is foreign demand.
'XENOPHOBIC' CLAIMS
Still, dramatic things have happened in the 10 weeks since the 15 per cent tax was announced.
Some industry lobbyists have been apoplectic. Reviving their silencing technique of the 1990s, they have claimed the tax is ""xenophobic.""
They also say it contravenes globalization agreements like 
NAFTA
. Metro Chinese student Jing Li, 29, is the lead plaintiffin a Canadian class-action suit that claims the tax contravenes 30 freetrade treaties. A group of Chinese billionaires, members of the China Entrepreneur Club, was in Chelsea, Que., on Tuesday to complain about the tax to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. It was the group's second meeting with Trudeau in less than two months.
The handful of Metro journalists covering the housing crisis two or three years ago has also now turned into a small army.
Housing has exploded into the province's biggest story, with Eby, the NDP housing critic, receiving lots of coverage.
In the past six months, especially since August, a dizzying upsurge of news stories has exposed the many legally dubious and criminal ways that realtors, lawyers, immigration ""consultants"" and major banks have helped foreign or dual-passport clients speculate in Canadian real estate.
News stories have uncovered the scams and loopholes that have helped thousands triple-flip properties, fake Canadian tax residency requirements, launder untold amounts of offshore money, obtain mortgages more easily than Canadian citizens, avoid capital gains on mansions and pretend to occupy large houses that are actually empty.
The federal Liberals also seem to be waking up to the situation.
In early October, Ottawa moved to tighten lending rules, making it harder for people without adequate equity to get a mortgage. The federal government has also suggested it will close a loophole that allows Canadian lawyers to launder foreign money. And it's hinted it may end the honour-system reporting that some foreign buyers have been abusing to avoid taxes on capital gains.
Many, however, remain skeptical. The federal government's enforcement of tax and immigration laws has long been underfunded and weak, say specialists. Ottawa's promises, they worry, may be mostly a public-relations exercise.
FUTURE FORECASTS
As for prices, it's hard to get people to agree on what's happened. Much of the speculation since Aug. 2 has focused on whether Metro's housing market bubble is bursting, as predicted in July by SFU economist emeritus Herb Grubel.
Even while the GVREB has claimed prices were about onequarter higher in September than a year earlier, real estate journalists argue it's underestimating the drop.
Postmedia has also reported that, since early August, prices have suddenly been rising in Victoria, Toronto and Seattle, which don't tax foreign buyers.
With all the political manoeuvring and volatile economies in Asia, few want to guess the future.
But 
Central 1 Credit Union
 chief economist Helmut Pastrick has estimated Metro prices could fall five to 10 per cent this year.
He also predicts prices will double over the next 25 years. Pastrick says demand will slowly rise again because one million more people, predominantly from offshore, are expected to move here by 2041.
Whatever politicians are thinking, the pressure on them to act on behalf of citizens, not foreign interests, has grown more intense in the past six months.

"A foreign buyers tax introduced in a surprise move by the B.C. Liberal government on Monday may cool the high end of Metro Vancouver's red hot real estate market, even if it contains several potential loopholes and unintended consequences, experts say.
The new 15 per cent foreign buyer tax will apply to residential real estate deals in Metro Vancouver - from Bowen Island to Maple Ridge and Langley township - starting Aug. 2, according to legislation.
It could add hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional taxes for buyers who aren't Canadian citizens or permanent residents, and potentially generate hundreds of millions in revenue the government plans to reinvest into affordable housing projects. A $2-million home in the Lower Mainland would see an extra $300,000 in property transfer tax if purchased by a foreign citizen. That would rise to $1.5 million on a $10-million home.
The tax isn't perfect, but it's a good move that could discourage foreign buyers who are pushing up the region's real estate prices, said Tom Davidoff, an associate professor at the University of B.C.'s Sauder School of Business.
""I think there are going to be foreign buyers turned off by this.
Fifteen per cent is a very big number,"" he said. ""I just can't believe anybody is going to pay $750,000 (in foreign buyer tax) on a $5-million home. I guess somebody might, but that's a hell of a tax to pay.""
The latest government data shows foreign buyers - mainly from China - purchased more than $1 billion worth of B.C. property between June 10 and July 14, and 86 per cent of that was in the Lower Mainland.
Countries that have tried taxing foreign investment report that it slows rising prices, UBC geography professor David Ley said.
""Other cities that have employed a tax at this kind of scale have indeed cooled the market at the top end,"" he said. ""It does have an effect.""
The tax also applies to corporations that purchase residential real estate - but not commercial properties - and government can examine the citizenship status of directors and the beneficiaries of corporate profits in deciding whether to add taxes.
The foreign buyers tax was a surprise move by Premier Christy Clark's government, which recalled the legislature for what it said was mainly policy-making to give the City of Vancouver the power to implement a vacancy tax.
Instead, Clark executed an abrupt about-face on her government's long-held reluctance to intervene in the housing market or discourage foreign investment in B.C.'s economy.
It also marked an end to a promise Clark made in 2015 that ""we really want to start knocking down the property transfer tax because it is a drag on our economy."" Clark had told the 
Surrey Board of Trade
 that reducing the property transfer tax would increase housing affordability.
On Monday, the premier said increasing the property transfer tax on foreigners is about ""making sure that British Columbians get first crack and best crack at buying new homes and existing homes when they come on the market.""
""There is evidence now that suggests that very wealthy foreign buyers have raised the price, the overall price of housing for people in British Columbia,"" she said.
""If we are going to put British Columbians first - and that is what we're intending to do - we need to make sure that we do everything that we can to try and keep houses affordable and to try and make sure that those very wealthy foreign buyers find it a little bit harder to buy a house in the Greater Vancouver area.""
Up until recently, the government had denied wealthy foreign investors were a contributing factor in skyrocketing Lower Mainland housing prices.
Clark and Finance Minister Mike de Jong would not speculate how much revenue the 15 per cent tax increase could generate, but a recent probe by the province into foreign home ownership offers a rough idea.
Earlier this month, de Jong said foreign nationals accounted for 6.5 per cent of the value of real estate transactions in Metro Vancouver between June 10 and 29. Were foreign buyers behind 6.5 per cent of all residential sales in Metro Vancouver in 2015 (a total value of nearly $55.07 billion, according to real estate data provided by 
Landcor Data Corporation
), and were they taxed 15 per cent on those purchases, the government would have raised about $537 million.
Any revenue would go into a special housing fund to be spent on housing affordability projects to be announced in coming weeks and months, de Jong said.
Davidoffand Ley said the money could help increase the supply of housing by encouraging municipalities to approve higher-density housing projects, and targeting development along new transit lines. However, the tax could have unintended consequences and loopholes. It relies on buyers self-reporting their nationality and providing a social insurance number, backed up by new auditing procedures and penalties.
""You hire yourself a tax lawyer, you hire yourself an accountant and you can get by that pretty quickly,"" NDP Leader John Horgan said. ""I think sophisticated investors, those who are laundering money in our real estate market, will be able to get by that very quickly.""
NDP critic David Eby said Canadian-owned companies that solicit foreign capital to buy property may also be able to get around the tax. Other experts floated the scenario of a person with citizenship buying property as a proxy for nonresident family members. The tax may also hurt recruitment by B.C. companies because international employees could face the foreign buyers tax while resettling in the province before they obtain resident status, Davidoff said.
It may also cause foreign speculation to spike in Greater Victoria, Kelowna and other parts of the province, the NDP argued.
The proposed law allows cabinet to later alter the foreign tax rate to between 10 to 20 per cent and expand it to outside the Lower Mainland.
The Liberal government's housing legislation also included the enabling power for Vancouver's vacancy tax, as well as an end to self-regulation of the real estate industry.
Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson told reporters Monday that he was pleased, but the city also needs homeowner data from the province to help with administering the tax and putting it in place as early as next year.
""It's too early to judge whether or not (the tax) will have a significant impact, but it's good to see,"" he said.
Surrey Coun. Judy Villeneuve, who is also president of the Surrey Homelessness and Housing Society, said she would like to know how the tax revenue would support housing. Villeneuve said very little affordable rental housing has been built in the past 20 years and what remains desperately needs to be upgraded or replaced with more rentals.
""I'd be very happy if they would transfer it to municipalities. I'd prefer that because we know what our needs are,"" Villeneuve said. ""But I'm being realistic that they probably won't.""

"After posting a noticeable lift in August, the building intentions of British Columbia contractors fell back down in September, figures in Statistics Canada's latest report on the value of building permits shows.
And the decline was in the non-residential sector, which was responsible for B.C.'s rise in activity in August.
B.C. contractors took out permits worth $666.7 million, a 27-per-cent drop from the $917 million taken out in August with all of the decline attributable to a decline in non-residential construction intentions.
Residential construction intentions rose in September with builders taking out permits for $487 million, a 39 per cent increase from the $350 million taken out in August.
However, non-residential permits totalled only $179.6 million in September, down 68 per cent from the $566.5 million taken out in August.
In Metro Vancouver, however, builders took out $372 million worth of permits, down just 2.4 per cent from the $381 million taken out in August.
Across Canada, the value of residential building permits rose 9.4 per cent in September, but gains in that sector were offset by a 9.1 per cent drop in non-residential permits, Statistics Canada said Thursday.
Overall, permits were up 1.6 per cent to $5.1 billion during the month -- the second straight monthly increase, the federal agency said.
The increase was in line with economists' forecasts.
""Overall, the value of building permits fell in three provinces (British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador) and two territories (Nunavut and Yukon),"" the agency said.
The value of residential permits rose to $3.2 billion, the highest level since September 2008. ""The increase was mainly a result of gains in the value of multi-family dwellings, especially in British Columbia and Ontario,"" the agency said. Permits were issued for 7,835 multi-family units in September, up 27.8 per cent.
Permits for single-family homes rose enough in six other provinces to offset a 5.4 per cent drop in Ontario and send the overall value up 0.2 per cent, to $2.1 billion.
In all, municipalities approved permits for 15,250 new dwellings across the country in September, an increase of 13.3 per cent.
Non-residential sector permits dropped 9.1 per cent to $1.9 billion in September, due mainly to declines in institutional and commercial building intentions in British Columbia.
The value of institutional permits fell 18.5 per cent to $597 million.
Fewer plans to build recreational facilities and laboratories in British Columbia and office buildings in Ontario accounted for the drop in commercial building intentions.
The value of industrial permits rose for the second month in a row, up 20 per cent to $363 million, largely due to projects for utility buildings in Quebec and Ontario.","B.C. building permits fall 27 per cent in September after rising in August; Decline seen in the non-residential sector, Statistics Canada reports",k,3
"OTTAWA
The value of building permits issued in June in Hamilton increased 289.3 per cent over the total for May, Statistics Canada reported yesterday.
The federal number-crunchers reported a total of $160.3 million worth of permits issued here in June.
Figures released by the city building department also show permits for work worth $106.4 million issued in July for 643 projects. So far this year the city has issued permits for projects worth $471.6 million, down almost 20 per cent from last year's tally of $587 million.
The value of permits across Canada totalled $5.2 billion, up 1 per cent from May, Statistics Canada reported.
Building permits are a key indicator of the health of the construction industry and the agency said June showed gains in both the residential and non-residential sectors.
But for the year to date, the value of permits is down 26.2 per cent from the same period last year.
The value of non-residential permits across Canada rose 1.5 per cent in June to $2.5 billion, following a nearly 20 per cent increase in May.
In the home-building sector, the value of permits increased for the fourth consecutive month in June, rising 0.5 per cent to $2.7 billion.
The value of building permits was up in every province except Alberta, Saskatchewan and Prince Edward Island.
In the non-residential sector, the value of permits rose 10.6 per cent to $1.3 billion. This was driven mainly by a rise in plans for hotel and laboratory construction in Ontario.
The value of institutional building permits fell 6.2 per cent to $902 million in June, after jumping 55.6 per cent in May. Increases in seven provinces were not enough to offset the drop in construction intentions for medical buildings in Alberta.
In the industrial component, the value of permits dropped 7.1 per cent to $332 million, ending a string of three consecutive monthly gains.
In the home sector, a rise in building permits for single-family dwellings cancelled out a decline in dollar terms in permits for multi-family dwellings.
Municipalities issued $1.7 billion worth of building permits for single-family dwellings in June, up 3.6 per cent from May. Quebec, Alberta and B.C. posted the largest gains, while Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan had decreases.
The value of building permits for multi-family dwellings fell 4.1 per cent to $1 billion, following a 40.1 per cent jump in May. The decline in June came mostly in Ontario.","Hamilton building permits spike; June value nearly triples from May, but this year's total down from last year",w,3
"Murray McNeill Manitoba remained one of the most affordable places in Canada to own a home in the second quarter of this year, even though it also had the biggest house-price increases in the country, according to a new housing affordability report from the Royal Bank.  
The report from RBC Financial said Manitoba led the country in affordability in three of four major housing categories -- two-storey detached homes, standard condos and standard townhouses.  
The only category in which it didn't fare as well was detached bungalows, where it ranked fourth lowest among the seven major regions covered in the report.  
The strong showing came in spite of the fact Manitoba was the only region in Canada to post a double-digit increase in house prices in three of the four housing categories. The only exception was condos, where the increase was 7.4 per cent. In the other three, it was 10.4 per cent for bungalows, 10.9 per cent for two-storey homes, and 10.8 per cent for townhouses.  
RBC economist Allan Seychuk said the two things that helped keep houses affordable in Manitoba in the face of double-digit prices increases were a four per cent increase in average annual income in the second quarter, which was the second biggest increase in the country behind Alberta's five per cent, and utility costs that were below the national average.  
""That really helped out,"" he said.  
The bank report pegged Manitoba's housing affordability index for a detached bungalow, which is considered a typical target home for first-time buyers, at 30.6 per cent in the second quarter.  
Best and worst  
That was down from 31.1 per cent in the first quarter of the year, and was substantially lower than national average of 36 per cent.  
The region with the best affordability index for bungalows was Atlantic Canada at 26.5 per cent, and the one with the worst was British Columbia at 53.7 per cent.  
Manitoba's affordability index for a standard two-storey home was 29.7 per cent, for a standard townhouse it was 17.3 per cent, and for a standard condo it was 15.7 per cent.  
The housing affordability index is the proportion of pre-tax household income needed to service the costs of owning a home, including mortgage payments, property taxes and utilities. The higher the index, the more costly it is to afford a home.  
For example, an affordability index of 30.6 means that home ownership costs take up 30.6 per cent of a typical household's pre-tax income. An index of 50 per cent means they take up 50 per cent.  
In Manitoba's case, an affordability index of 30.6 per cent meant it cost the average Manitoban, with a home valued at $173,000 and a median household income of $48,300, $1,230 a month to own that bungalow during the second quarter of this year.  
Although Winnipeg wasn't included, Seychuk said Winnipeg's index would be essentially the same as Manitoba's, which would have given it the second best affordability index after Edmonton.

"Calgary's housing affordability deteriorated for the fourth consecutive quarter and is now ""substantially worse"" than a year ago, according to a report released Thursday by RBC Economics.  
The RBC affordability index, which measures the proportion of pre-tax household income needed to service the costs of owning a home, is 32.7 per cent in Calgary for a detached bungalow, 34.4 per cent for a standard two-storey home, 24.4 per cent for a standard townhouse and 20 per cent for a standard condo.  
""Calgary's deteriorating housing affordability trend continued for a fourth consecutive quarter and picked up speed,"" said the report. ""Conditions were substantially worse than a year ago in all segments of homes.  
""This overall erosion in Calgary's affordability was largely price-led with all classes of homes experiencing roughly 30 per cent price appreciation in the first quarter of 2006 compared to a year ago.""  
The housing affordability index has been compiled by RBC since 1985. The higher the index, the more costly it is to afford a home. For example, an affordability index of 50 per cent means that homeownership costs, including mortgage payments, utilities and property taxes, take up 50 per cent of a typical household's monthly pre-tax income.  
Kevin Clark, president of the Calgary Real Estate Board, said the numbers are not surprising considering the price growth in the past year for homes in Calgary.  
""The marketplace certainly puts restraints on some buyers and will continue to do so just as when interest rates go up a certain percentage of the marketplace drops off the bottom because they just become unaffordable. The same thing is happening within this marketplace,"" said Clark.  
""I would equally stress, though, the importance of buyer flexibility within this marketplace, talking to their realtors about other choices, other selections. The more rigid the criteria for the buyer, the harder it's going to be in some sectors. . . . Certainly, if a buyer is prepared to look at alternate communities, alternate lifestyles . . . all of those flexibilities allow people different choices.""  
Derek Holt, assistant chief economist for RBC, said for Calgary the ""overwhelming influence compared to other markets in Canada was what happened to house prices.""  
""It doesn't really matter which segment we're looking at in the resale market or new home prices they're up 30 per cent year-over-year. That would be the No. 1 factor,"" said Holt. ""I would then rate what happened to mortgage rates as the second most significant factor. . . . It was what happened to prices and mortgage rates that just swamped what was actually even despite all of that pretty decent income growth.  
""I'd label that price appreciation as the dominant factor that's just not sustainable going forward.""  
In Calgary, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. is forecasting average monthly carrying costs for people buying homes this year to average $1,960 -- a 34.9 per cent increase from the previous year. The carrying costs, which include principal and interest, are based on average resale prices, a 10 per cent down payment and a 25-year amortization.  
CMHC forecasts the average resale price of a Calgary home -- including condos and single-family homes -- will rise this year to $314,300, representing a 25.3 per cent jump, the highest on record.  
And, by the end of 2007, the average price of a resale home could hit $341,000.  
CMHC is also forecasting resale single-family homes to increase in price by 26 per cent to an average of $348,500 this year while condos will increase 24.9 per cent to $230,000.  
The situation in Calgary is mirrored across the province, as the cost of owning a home in Alberta continued to increase as rising house prices and mortgage rates outpaced strong income and employment growth for the second consecutive quarter, according to the report.  
In Alberta, the housing affordability index for a standard condo was 19.9 per cent, 22.3 per cent for a standard townhouse, 30.5 per cent for a detached bungalow, and 33.8 per cent for a standard two-storey home.  
""The good times for the Alberta economy have come at a cost to homebuyers as the housing market has witnessed year-over-year price growth of about 25 per cent in all classes of homes,"" said Holt. ""In just one quarter alone, two-storey homeowners realized an average $28,000 price gain.""  
The report says lower utility bills and lower property taxes in Alberta were not enough to provide relief to homeownership costs. These costs were up about 10 per cent in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter and up 22 per cent compared to the same period last year.

"A surge in new listings helped to push house prices a little lower and make most types of homes a little more affordable in the final three months of 2013, a new Royal Bank report says.
In its latest quarterly Housing Trends and Affordability Report released Tuesday, RBC Economics Research said the cost of owning a standard two-storey home in the province declined by 1.1 percentage points to 38.6 per cent of pre-tax household income during the quarter. And the cost of owning a standard bungalow dipped by 0.6 percentage points to 38 per cent.
The only type of home that bucked that trend was standard condominiums, where home-ownership costs rose by 0.8 percentage points to 24.9 per cent, the bank said.
The report said more listings in the latter part of 2013 meant more choice for homebuyers, which helped to drive prices slightly lower.
And more balanced market conditions should help keep prices rising at a moderate pace in the first half of 2014, it said, although rising interest rates could erode affordability later in the year.
""While we expect the 
Bank of Canada
 to leave its overnight rate unchanged in 2014, we forecast an upward drift in bond yields -- the main driver of fixed mortgage rates -- ahead of what is likely to be a gradual pace of policy tightening by both the U.S. and Canadian central banks,"" the bank said.
Craig Wright, RBC's senior vice-president and chief economist, said the slight decline in prices in the late stages of 2013 kept home ownership in Manitoba relatively affordable compared with most other major Canadian cities.
""Our measures for all housing types in the province stayed reasonably on par with historical norms in the province, suggesting that little affordability pressure is being exerted on Manitoba's homebuyers at the present time,"" he added.
That's a welcome change from the first three quarters of 2013, when affordability deteriorated in the face of escalating house prices.
The bank said the average price for a bungalow in Manitoba in Q4 was $308,500, which was down 1.1 per cent from the previous quarter. The average price for a two-storey home was $310,500, which was a drop of 2.6 per cent from the previous quarter.
However, the average price for a standard condo rose by 5.5 per cent to $207,600.
The RBC housing affordability measure is based on the cost of owning a detached bungalow, two-storey home or condo at market value. The higher the measure, the more difficult it is to afford a home. For example, an affordability reading of 50 per cent means homeowner costs, including mortgage payments, utilities and property taxes, would take up 50 per cent of a typical household's monthly pre-tax income.
British Columbia continues to have the least affordable housing, with an affordability measure for a standard bungalow of 67.7 per cent. And Vancouver continues to be the least affordable city, with an affordability measure for a bungalow of 81.6 per cent.
Winnipeg was not one of the six cities where affordability was measured.
Nationally, after two straight quarters of modest deterioration, housing affordability improved mildly in Canada in the final quarter of 2013 due to stronger income gains.

"The good ship Alberta hasn't sailed off the end of the earth, but the last three years have been fraught with stormy waters.
Yet, the worst for the province's housing markets may be behind us.
In its Housing Market Outlook report*, 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation
 sees some balance returning over its forecast period of 2019 and 2020.
In review, 2018 hasn't measured up to sales expectations. The lack of demand has left markets unbalanced, driving up inventories in the new homes and resale homes markets. At the end of October, almost 5,000 new homes stood empty in Alberta's major markets, led by Edmonton (2,362) and Calgary (2,153). In the resale category, the sales-tonew listings ratio averaged around 45 percent, indicative of more supply than demand. CMHC expects demand to increase through the forecast period.
""Alberta's housing markets are expected to transition to more balanced conditions,"" says the report. ""Employment and income are expected to rise and stronger demographic growth will gradually increase housing demand.""
For 2019, the agency expects new housing starts in Alberta to be relatively stable compared to 2018's production, with an uptick in 2020, based on a reduction of inventory and improvement in market balance in the new home and resale markets.
""Over the forecast period, expected growth in full-time employment and rising net migration will contribute to the demand of housing,"" says CMHC. ""On the other hand, demand will be moderated by rising mortgage rates. Over the next two years, 
MLS
 sales in Alberta are expected to be relatively stable and only gradually rise.""
Stabilization is also forecast for prices. ""Through nine months of 2018, the average 
MLS
 price in Alberta was approximately $390,000, down 2.6 percent from the same period in 2017. Buyers'market conditions are expected to slowly subside and this will help stabilize housing prices in 2019,"" says CMHC. ""Market conditions are not expected to substantially lift the average 
MLS
 price in 2020 and price growth will continue to be relatively flat.""
As usual, most rental markets will benefit first from net migration.
""The vacancy rate in Alberta's rental market is projected to gradually decline over the forecast period, with the exception of oilsandsdriven economies such as Wood Buffalo and Cold Lake where vacancy rates are expected to remain elevated,"" says CMHC. ""Net interprovincial migration is turning positive and these new households will help lower the vacancy rate in Alberta. However, outflows from rental tenure to homeownership will continue to create vacancies. Rental incentives in the marketplace are expected to gradually decline over the forecast period. The average rent in Alberta is projected to stabilize in 2018 with rent increases likely below the rate of inflation in 2019 and 2020.""
Here are CMHC's views of the Calgary market.
New home starts to remain flat
""The Calgary CMA is currently facing elevated levels of completed and unabsorbed inventory."" (At the end of October, there were 2,153 unsold new homes on the market, including 1,006 apartments.)
""Elevated inventories are largely due to unsold apartment units, which make up half of all inventory in Calgary. Inventory for semi-detached and row units are also elevated, but make up a smaller share of total inventory. Single-detached inventories are largely in-line with historical levels. The number of units that are currently under construction provide insight on potential inventory.""
At the end of October, there were 11,873 homes under construction, including 7,443 apartments.
""Given the current level of inventory and units under construction, it is anticipated that total housing starts in 2019 and 2020 will be similar to production in 2018.""
Resale market to slowly firm
""Active listings in Calgary's resale market have been trending higher, while 
MLS
 sales have been lower due to relatively weaker economic fundamentals in the market. On a yearto-date basis, 
MLS
 sales have decreased 13.5 percent from September 2017. Increasing supply with decreasing demand has resulted in buyers'market conditions. A slow economic recovery from the past recession has kept labour market conditions soft, where the unemployment rate in Calgary was 8.2 percent in September 2018.
""Various factors will push and pull the demand for housing in Calgary in 2019 and 2020. On aggregate, it is anticipated that Calgary's economy will experience stronger growth in population and employment. This will help support demand and lift 
MLS
 sales in 2019 and 2020. However, it will take time for the market to transition to conditions that are more balanced. The average 
MLS
 price will continue facing downward pressure but is expected to stabilize in 2019 and modestly rise in 2020.""
Vacancy rates to move lower
""Employment growth and the continued influx of interprovincial and international migrants is expected to drive the demand for rentals over the forecast horizon in Calgary.
""Migration estimates for Alberta have shown positive interprovincial migration in the first half of 2018 after nearly two years of more people leaving than coming into the province. As this trend is expected to continue, population growth in Calgary is projected to increase at a faster rate through 2020. Vacancy rates are expected to trend lower through 2020, however, competition from the secondary rental market will keep vacancy rates from declining faster. Rental incentives in the marketplace are projected to gradually recede and rents are expected to stabilize before rising modestly in 2020.""

"A positive economic environment, job creation and a low unemployment rate will fuel housing demand in the Calgary region for the next two years, leading to steady growth in the market.
According to a new report released Monday by 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp
., MLS sales in the Calgary census metropolitan area will grow to 23,000 transactions in 2012 and to 23,700 in 2013 from 22,466 in 2011. The CMHC said the average sale price will rise from $402,851 in 2011 to $409,000 in 2012 and $420,000 in 2013.
The CMHC is predicting housing starts in the Calgary region to jump from 9,292 in 2011 to 10,300 in 2012 and 10,700 in 2013.
""Economic activity in Calgary will continue to support housing demand throughout the forecast period,"" said Richard Cho, senior market analyst in Calgary for the CMHC. ""Sustained investments in the energy sector will not only create jobs in the energy industry but also promote activity in other industries leading to more employment opportunities for job seekers.
""Employment levels in Calgary steadily rose in 2011 and the same is expected for 2012 . . . we can expect to see higher migration flows to Calgary, which is also an important driver for housing demand. In addition, favourable mortgage rates will also contribute to more sales in the new home and resale market.""
He said elevated active listings in the competing resale market have in the past contributed to fewer single-detached housing starts. But as the resale market becomes more balanced this year, combined with improving demand, new home construction will grow in the single-detached sector.
""Multi-family construction will also pick up this year and next, mainly from higher apartment starts. Apartment inventories have come down from their elevated levels providing some builders an opportunity to start more projects and help satisfy demand,"" he said.
In Alberta, the CMHC forecasts housing starts to jump from 25,704 in 2011 to 29,100 in 2012 and 30,000 in 2013. Provincially, MLS sales are forecast to jump from 53,146 in 2011 to 54,650 in 2012 and 56,550 in 2013. The average MLS sale price will rise from $355,808 in 2011 to $363,650 this year and $372,300 next year.
The CMHC report said net migration to Alberta is on an upward trend due to economic growth, job creation and low unemployment rates and the 2011 count will almost double 2010's total of 19,613, which was a 15-year low. The CMHC estimates net migration in 2011 at 38,500 followed by 39,000 in 2012 and 39,500 in 2013.
""Over the forecast period, net migration will be close to the 10-year average with about 40,000 people added each year, increasing housing demand for rental and home ownership,"" said the report.

"Calgary's housing market is the hot topic of conversation these days not only in the city but across the country.
The once-sizzling real estate sector has cooled tremendously thanks to a precipitous decline in oil prices and that has people, from economists to realtors to homeowners and potential buyers, speculating and wondering what that will do to housing prices.
And there is no lack of opinion on the topic, ranging from forecasts of a small increase in average prices for the year to a 10 per cent or more decline. MLS sales are expected to fall dramatically this year - TD recently said by as much as nearly 50 per cent - with new listings rising at a steep pace.
""There is no surprise that the range is so vast. Trying to forecast an average sale price change ... in today's market is impossible,"" said Don Campbell, senior analyst with the Real Estate Investment Network. ""Why? Simply because the most important variable is not known.
""How long oil will stay under $70 and how confident the oil industry is about it levelling at that number. Without that knowledge, real estate market price forecasting is mathematically impossible.""
According to the 
Calgary Real Estate Board
, year-to-date up to and including Saturday there have been 1,758 MLS sales, down 37.17 per cent from the same period last year, while new listings have risen by 24.66 per cent to 5,551. The average sale price has dropped by 2.17 per cent to $463,938.
Since 1990, the annual average MLS sale price has fallen from the previous year only four times - 1991, by 1.08 per cent; 1995, by 0.47 per cent; 2008, by 2.46 per cent; and 2009, by 4.67 per cent.
The biggest annual hike was recorded in 2006 when prices soared by 39.78 per cent from the previous year to $358,385 and then jumped another 18.25 per cent in 2007 to $423,798.
According to the Conference Board of Canada, the city's economic growth in 2006 was 7.0 per cent - the second highest rate of growth in the past 25 years behind only the 7.9 per cent recorded in 1997.
Christina Hagerty, a realtor with RE/MAX Realty Professionals, who started in the business in 1991, said real estate in Calgary has always been a good long-term investment.
""In fact, if you look at real estate values over the course of 10 years, all have performed double to triple their value right across the board, not just in the inner core,"" said Hagerty, who specializes in that area. ""So the old-timers like us who have seen a couple of decades of activity aren't fretting.""
Hagerty said the current rental vacancy rate in the city remains low. That combined with some of the lowest interest rates in history and still good overall consumer confidence will keep the real estate market healthy.
""I would say based on this, housing prices should continue to see a slight positive gain. Unless there are reasons for sellers to take a substantial decrease, most would not do so. Why would you want to lose 10 per cent on your real estate value when you can lease out for a premium based on such low vacancy rates?"" she said.
Ann-Marie Lurie, chief economist with CREB, said there is a wide range of price expectations for this year because there is a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the duration of lower oil prices and ultimately the impact on employment.
""Regardless if you look at average, median or benchmark prices, annual home prices within city limits declined in 2008 and 2009,"" she said.
""During that time several global economies were in a recession. In 2009 Calgary saw GDP contract by nearly four per cent, net migration fell, full-time jobs were being lost, there was a large amount of newlyconstructed product available, and the impact of the financial crises created several changes to the lending industry.
""This year the housing market has seen sales activity fall, likely a result of reduced consumer confidence in the market. At the same time, listings have continued to rise, driving up inventories. If this continues, this will place downward pressure on pricing. However, to reach the double-digit decline rates in housing prices, this would assume that the energy prices would stay low for this year with not much upside prospect into 2016, causing job losses, low levels of migration, and persistent excess supply in the housing market.""
For prices to remain stable, said Lurie, the city would have to see stability in the employment sector and the pace of new listings slow.
""With this much uncertainty I think it is prudent to consider there are several factors that can drive the prices. Based on current expectations, prices are likely to remain at or just below levels recorded near the end of last year,"" she added.
Hagerty said Calgary is a young city and many people are not used to the volatility of the oilpatch and its relation to the real estate market.
""So those of us who have been around for a couple of decades aren't concerned,"" said Hagerty.
""We aren't day-trading real estate. We get to live in this tangible asset as it grows in value. Savvy investors are sitting back hopeful the next seller will think the sky is falling so they can seize the opportunity. They know that Calgary's a sure thing with strong fundamentals that make it a great investment.""
Campbell said real estate continues to be a strong long-term investment and income replacement. ""We have always believed that real estate is a safe long-term play. The numbers don't lie - since prices have begun to be tracked, they have increased,"" he said. ""Of course we have seen short-term fluctuation with dips and corrections, but in the long term the arrow has always pointed up.
""Calgarians have hosted many an oil boom party in the past and have learned of these inevitable dips. However, because the province's population, and the city itself, has grown at record numbers over the last two years, we have a large cohort of the population who have never experienced a Calgary ebb and flow. That has led to an increase in knee-jerk response in the market as shown by the dramatic increase in listings.""
He said it is at about this point that strategic Calgary investors start to hunt for good deals, knowing that when the market recovers - be it in one or two years - that it will prove to be the ultimate buying window.

"One firm promises to post your home on the Multiple Listing Service for a penny. Another boasts that it's cheaper to use lawyers than realtors. A third encourages agents to bid on listings to see who might offer the best prices and services.
At least half a dozen new innovative Canadian companies have been launched in the wake of a decision by the federal Competition Bureau to challenge the rules of organized real estate.
This does not sit well with traditional realtors, who see their industry under attack. The newcomers are being characterized as upstarts offering more hype than service. But they say the old rules don't apply any more.
The winners, so far, are consumers in what has been an unprecedented spring awakening for the normally stodgy world of real-estate marketing.
""The old system was too rigid. I love competition because you have to be dynamic and creative,"" said realtor Dawson Pereira. ""I have been waiting a long time for this, people finally get to choose.""
Last month, Pereira launched his new brokerage, touting a 1-cent listing service. The former ReMax agent charges an upfront fee of $600 to list a property on the Multiple Listing Service, a key database of homes that account for the vast majority of sales in Canada. If the property sells within 10 days, he will refund the fee minus 1 cent.
The 10-day rule, while gimmicky, isn't impossible in the current market. On his website www.savetherealtorfees.com[http://www.savetherealtorfees.com], Pereira lists 20 homes selling for $1 million or more that have sold on MLS in one day during March and April.
""We're basically selling advertising space,"" said Pereira, who is still waiting for his first customer. ""If people think that it's that easy to sell a house then I will give them the opportunity. I can't give them a year, but I will give them 10 days.""
Since the Competition Bureau declared war on the Canadian Real Estate Association's monopoly on the MLS earlier this year, emboldened realtors have launched new schemes challenging the status quo.
They also hope to get a jump on the market by launching a pre-emptive strike before the regulatory dust settles.
Analysts say the current environment is a fragile perestroika that could be fleeting if reforms are not enforced with a court ruling. The Competition Bureau has a date with CREA later this year to settle their differences before a tribunal.
CREA, which owns the MLS system, says they have already opened up the market with rule changes implemented this year, while the Competition Bureau says they need to go further.
""During the early years you'll see an awful lot of these fledgling companies fail to get off the ground, but some may prove to be truly innovative,"" said John Andrew, director of executive seminars on corporate and investment real estate at Queen's University. ""Hats off to the Competition Bureau for providing the impetus to an industry that has been mired in the past.""
Earlier this year, under pressure from the bureau, CREA relaxed some rules, giving an opening to entrepreneurs such as Pereira.
The fact that so many companies are now appearing is testimony that there is demand out there that has been stifled by regulation, said realtor Ajay Jain.
""It's crazy that most real estate marketing is mired in the 1970s with bus shelter ads and flyers,"" said Jain, who has his own brokerage firm that specializes in investment properties.
Last month, Jain launched www.ibidbroker.com[http://www.ibidbroker.com], where realtors get to bid for prospective customers. Vendors place their listing on the site, and agents send in a marketing plan and other details, such as how much they expect in commission.
""Why not have agents competing for your business? The homeowner wins because he gets the best basket of services and price,"" Jain said.
Vendors get to use the service for free, but agents pay $30 to submit a bid. So far, 200 agents and about 100 home sellers have registered on the website, according to Jain.
The idea came to the 29-year-old Toronto man after booking a trip to the Bahamas last year on a travel website. Why wasn't it as easy to find a realtor?
By putting in where he wanted to go, airlines ended up essentially bidding for his business and he ended up finding the cheapest price.
Jain wondered if the concept, essentially a ""dating service"" for agents and vendors, would work. He put $100,000 worth of his savings into finding the answer.
Because marketing costs are typically the biggest part of an agent's budget, Jain hopes it will be a hit.
For new agents, breaking into the market can be cost-prohibitive. But if they are aggressive and willing to give a vendor good deals, the system will work for them, he argues. There is also a feedback area, which will be familiar to those who shop on 
eBay
, which will allow customers to review agents.
""The good agents who are offering value will love this,'' Jain said. ""The agents who have been getting by in a hot market are not going to be happy.""
Murtaza Haider, director of the Institute of Housing and Mobility Studies at Ryerson University, says one big reason the new companies are ""coming out of the woodwork"" is because they feel the industry is opening up to them. ""With a Competition Tribunal around the corner, they (CREA) will be reluctant to crack down. So that is giving the new start-ups encouragement.""
But Haider cautions that the growth of innovative companies might be restricted in the future if there is no resolution on what exactly can be allowed in the marketplace.
One thing is for sure: If the market starts to slow in the second half of the year, as expected, agents are going to have to work a lot harder.
New discounters entering the market are also going to make it a tougher slog for some realtors. And with the deregulation of the MLS, they're also under the gun from others, such as lawyers, who are muscling in on their action.
Michael Forcier, a lawyer and one of the owners of propertyshop.ca., argues it doesn't make sense to use agents at all if you can use a lawyer.
He is pushing a service he says is cheaper than using realtors and has the security of using lawyers throughout the transaction.
""It only makes sense if you are going to sell your house without an agent; then use your lawyer from the beginning of the transaction,"" he said.
Customers still have to market and sell their own home, but it will be listed on the MLS and a lawyer will provide legal advice through the entire transaction for about 1 per cent commission.
That's far cheaper than the average 2.5 per cent that a vendor's real estate agent would charge, on top of legal fees for closing, he argues.
Forcier based his model on solicitor-operated offices in Edinburgh, Scotland, where the majority of real estate sales are conducted through lawyers for less than the average 5 per cent total commission it often takes to sell a home in Canada.
He decided to team up with an Ottawa company offering $109 MLS listings after reading about the business in the Star. The listings are uploaded to the MLS.ca site.
Since he started to offer the option of MLS, Forcier says inquiries have doubled from customers looking for an alternative way to sell their home and from lawyers looking to join his organization.
The ability to use the MLS and lawyers means you can effectively cut out the middlemen - the agent.
That kind of thinking does not sit well with organized real estate, with many agents already under siege from consumers who see more options available and suddenly want a better deal.
""It's an exciting time in the real estate brokerage industry,"" said Phil Soper, CEO of Royal LePage, who says many consumers still greatly appreciate the value that a realtor brings to the table.
""The public debate surrounding regulatory change has encouraged entrepreneurs to try new things, which is great. Gimmicks will attract few clients, however, and result in even fewer long term business relationships. When you pay a commission fee, you are paying for a professional's time. As the market cools, the time it takes to sell a home will increase and these penny-novelty businesses will simply fade away.""
Not everyone agrees. Queen's University professor Andrew says the marketplace has already been irrevocably changed. And he thinks for the better.
""The floodgates have already opened. It's going to be hard to put this genie back in the bottle,"" Andrew said. ""And that's going to be good for consumers.""","Changing the face of competitive home selling, from 1-cent listings to cheap lawyer advice",j,7
"People looking to buy or sell their home may soon have more choices and more information at their fingertips, thanks to rule changes that could revolutionize the way realtors work.
When Katie Dunsworth wanted to buy a house earlier this year, she knew she would use a realtor to find the best property quickly and to negotiate on her behalf.
However, when it came to selling her downtown Vancouver condo, the 28-yearold questioned the need to employ one.
After several weeks of trying to sell the condo on her own, and with just a month before closing the deal on her new house, Dunsworth decided that she did need a realtor to get the condo listed on the Multiple Listing Service, where more than 90 per cent of home sales in Canada are advertised and cleared.
'FOR THAT MONEY, WHAT AM I GETTING?'
She hired a full-service realtor, and her condo was sold in a day.
Dunsworth is a founding member of the Smart Cookies, a group of five women who pulled themselves out of debt and who now help others with financial tips. She is married to Nick Reiach, and has an infant daughter, Hannah.
""I think my generation in particular, which is super savvy online ... [is] beginning to question things. First of all, let's be transparent and honest about how much you're going to make on this deal. Secondly, for that money, what am I getting?"" Dunsworth said.
""I did not see that in my experience. I saw, here's what you're paying and I'm going to
sell your property in a day so just trust me."" A year ago the Canadian Competition Bureau began to open up choices, and possibly break realtors' monopoly on MLS information for consumers like Dunsworth with an application to the Competition Tribunal.
That application, which the Canadian Real Estate Association agreed to last October, gives Canadians the ability to choose which services they want from a real estate agent when selling their home, and to pay only for those selected services.
CUSTOM-BUILT SALES PACKAGE
For example, a customer like Dunsworth could pay a realtor for placing their
home on the Multiple Listing Service, and pay only for that, while doing the rest of the selling, such as holding open houses or negotiating the selling price themselves.
Although these types of services have been available for a while, the rul ing means real estate boards cannot discriminate against realtors offering à la carte services.
Among a few companies offering this type of service in B.C. is One Flat Fee, a Surrey real estate company that offers customers options in realtor services when selling that range from $499 to $3,499. Customers can handle as much, or as little, of the sale as they wish.
Raj Johal, who works with Mayur Arora at One Flat Fee, said things are going very well for the company since the changes came in.
The company has listed 463 properties so far and has sold 203 homes, Arora said in an email.
'VIRTUAL OFFICE'
The Competition Bureau has filed a subsequent application, which is still being considered, that would open up the information contained in the MLS database that was previously only available when provided by a realtor.
The application seeks to have the Toronto Real Estate Board approve allowing realtors to have a ""virtual office"" that buyers can use with a user name and password, and that would give them access to information not provided on the MLS at realtor.ca. Although realtors in B.C. can already give their customers access to a virtual office, the ruling could open up even more information. Examples of the type of information that would be available include statistics such as the number of days a property has been on the market, selling history or even community information such as the crime rate in the surrounding neighbourhood. In the U.S., there are many websites with this type of information without signing in, such as 
Zillow. com
.
Ross McCredie, president and CEO of 
Sotheby's International Realty
 Canada, said in an interview that younger buyers like Dunsworth will expect instant access to more information.
""Generation Y is a completely different animal and I love it,"" McCredie said. ""You're talking about people who have so much information. When they make decisions, it's not old school.
""They'll text six of their friends and maybe tweet something out.
""They will get as much information [as they possibly can] quickly. If the industry doesn't
provide quick, good information, they will get lost.""
The Canadian Real Estate Association is trying to balance the wishes of realtors who want to provide more choice and information, and those who don't.
""There is a groundswell of support from the field of people who want to be able to provide this service online through websites or virtual offices,"" said Pierre Leduc, spokesman for CREA.
""There are other people who don't want to provide that information - so it's trying to be the honest broker in the middle and find a common ground. So that the people who do want to provide this service can, and the people who don't want to, don't have to.""
TECHNOLOGY FOSTERS CHANGE
Dunsworth said she pushed her realtor for information such as the number of days on the market and previous sales history because she used that information to save time.
""If you have a finite amount of time - I have a small daughter - you don't have time to go view a lot of properties,"" Dunsworth said, adding that she absolutely supports the idea of having more information readily available online.
Dunsworth was happy overall with both her selling and buying experience, but says she sees a trend among her peers to question the amount of money and the services provided by realtors.
Vancouver-based Click Realty is one of the companies that has cropped up hoping to catch on to the trend of younger buyers demanding more information and questioning the fees charged for realtors.
""Technology has changed the way we buy cars, the way we bank, the way we book travel - everything,"" said Barry Allen, comanaging partner of Click Realty along with Fiona Therrien and Victor Therrien.
""Technology, through the MLS and iPads and cellphones, has changed the way realtors do their job. It has fundamentally changed the work that a realtor does, but it hasn't benefited the consumer.""
Click Realty refunds 50 per cent of the commission fee on their end of a property sale back to the buyer or seller. They're doing this, the managing partners say, because it is a fair price for the work they are doing, especially considering that 94 per cent of home buyers start the search on their own.
All home purchases and sales have two sides to the commission: the buyer's and the seller's. If the other half of the deal is represented by another company, that realtor will receive the full commission.
""If you think of the average house selling price in Vancouver as $1 million, the commissions would be $40,000, so you could save $10,000. Often when you're buying or selling a home, deals fall apart over $1,000,"" Allen said in an interview. Victor Therrien added that it's possible for a realtor to make as much in one transaction as the average annual income for a Canadian.
""The commissions are so high there is animosity in the industry on behalf of customers towards agents,"" Kate Therrien said.
""The numbers are so big that if we run a decent business we're going to make money. There's no reason to maintain the belief that we're entitled to these massive commissions.""
In addition to refunding 50 per cent of realty fees to consumers, Click Realty has started a separate arm of the company with a focus on technology, in an effort to give consumers more access to information.
""If the consumer is given the information, allowed to make educated decisions and serviced properly the entire industry wins,"" Fiona Therrien said.
McCredie said he believes the real estate industry is only hurting themselves by keeping information away from consumers.
""At the end of the day, there will still be real estate agents. They're not going to go away, but I think what you will be able to find is if you see a home you're interested in, you'll be able to pull up a lot of information instantly on your iPhone or your BlackBerry,"" McCredie said.
Vancouver Royal LePage City Centre realtor Jason Deeth said the people he works with have been happy to have a professional negotiating on their behalf.
""The analogy I like to use is [that] just because anybody can go buy all the tools and building materials they want doesn't mean that suddenly there's no demand for skilled, experienced tradespeople,"" Death said in an email.
""No matter who you are, dealing with hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars can be nerve-racking - especially if it's your own money. I know people that lose all sense of judgment when it comes to buying a pair of jeans.""
Dunsworth, who has enjoyed her Cambie Village home for a few months now, said she thinks people will always be willing to pay for realtors to save themselves time, as long as they think they are getting good service.
""I really see there being a place for realtors, but they need to be transparent about what they're getting paid for, they need to be marketing professionals and they need to bring something extra to the table,"" Dunsworth said.

"A real estate agent will tell you his or her services are worth every penny.
But in a hot real estate market like Toronto, do you really need one?
The average GTA home is selling in just 20 days, according to the Greater Toronto Real Estate Board, so you can see why some homeowners might question the value of paying a full service agent.
The average GTA home price in April was $577,898 - up 10 per cent from the same time last year.
Based on that price, a standard commission of 5 per cent - 2.5 per cent each to the listing agent and the selling agent - would set you back close to $29,000 in fees.
The average sale price of a detached home in the City of Toronto hit $965,670 in April, so the fee would be that much more at $48,284.
That's why many sellers are drawn to discount realtor options and do-it-yourself kits to help sell their homes. The trouble is that many real estate agents disregard properties when they know they'll get paid nothing, or do much less than usual to help sell them.
Robert McLister, founder of the mortgage rate site RateSpy.com, says there's no question a bias exists against the discounters.
He's had first-hand experience, having sold his home in nine days after listing with a full-service agent.
Prior to that, his property sat for several months when he tried listing on his own.
""We had a dozen showings in the first few days after re-listing with a commission, but just one showing in five months when we used a $1,000 flat-fee MLS listing service,"" said McLister.
This bias may not apply to agents who build a minimum fee into their buyer representation agreements (since they know they'll earn something, even if the vendor isn't offering a commission).
McLister says that not all discount brokerages pay less than the going rate to co-operating agents. Some charge only 1 per cent or a flat fee to list, but still pay 2.5 per cent to the buyer's agent.
You can list your home for as little as $800 using a service like ComFree.com, which includes an MLS listing, a lawn sign, high quality photos, coaching and support from a licensed realtor. Since 1997, over 130,000 Canadians have sold their homes through ComFree.
Another alternative to a traditional real estate agent is a service like PropertyGuys.com. In 15 years, they've helped nearly 60,000 Canadian home sellers save on real estate commissions. For $2,600 you'll get your property listed on MLS, a professional appraiser will help you with your pricing strategy and a lawyer can assist you through the process.
Let's say you are an active buyer and have enlisted the help of a real estate agent. Most buyers will scan the MLS listings on Realtor.ca and let their agent know which homes they'd like to visit. If one happened to be listed with a discount brokerage, would your realtor steer you away from it? Not likely if they want to keep their customer happy - most agents would grin and bear it.
But if a buyer happened to be looking in an unfamiliar city and had asked an agent to come up with a list of houses to show, there's a good chance any homes listed with a discounter won't make the cut.
The sweet spot might lie in a service like One Percent Realty. Founded in British Columbia in 1999, One Percent Realty is a full service brokerage that charges the same $6,900 commission whether your home sells for $200,000 or $600,000. For homes priced over $600,000, they charge a commission rate of 1 per cent, plus $900 for the same full services.
Darren Chamish, a broker at One Percent Realty, says that while there's a perception other realtors won't show your home if it's listed with a discount realtor, the fact is that over 80 per cent of One Percent Realty's listing sales were sold by co-operating realtors representing the buyer.
Of the $6,900 commission, $3,000 is paid to the buyer's agent. That's much less than they're used to, but worth it if it means a happy client gets the home they wanted.
Chamish says that bias hasn't hurt business. In its third year of operation in Ontario, One Percent has over 50 agents and handles more than 100 offers per month.

"As resale activity of single-family homes dipped across the city last month, new listings didn't continue their soaring pace from January.
There were 739 single-family homes sold on the resale market in February, a 31.5 per cent decline from 1,080 transactions a year ago, says the 
Calgary Real Estate Board
. During the same stretch, there was a 7.5 per cent bump in new listings with 1,674 units added to the market compared to 1,556 a year earlier.
That marked a slower addition to the single-family home supply than January, when new listings jumped 32 per cent from the same time in 2014.
""While housing supply levels continue to be higher than we have seen in this market for some time, they remain below February 2008 record highs of nearly 7,000 units,"" said CREB chief economist Ann-Marie Lurie. ""If the pace of growth in new listings continues to ease, this could place some downward pressure on the supply growth in the resale market.""
The inventory of single-family homes on the resale market last month reached 2,946 units, which is double the 1,469 count a year ago.
Buyers paid six per cent more for a single-family home in February than they did during the same month in 2014. The benchmark price last month was $516,000 and in February of last year it was $486,800. Benchmark prices are that of a typical home based on a formula that uses various factors to ensure accurate comparisons.
""It's really important for consumers to consider what segment of the market they are buying or selling in when they make any real estate decisions,"" said CREB president Corinne Lyall. ""The inventory, demand and price movement will vary based on the community, price range and product type.""
Northwest Calgary was the busiest area in the city for single-family home sales on the resale market last month. Zone A, which roughly covers the quadrant, logged 253 deals. The benchmark price of these sales was $527,900, five per cent more than it was a year earlier. Sales in the zone were led by Tuscany with 20, and 17 each in Evanston and Coventry Hills.
Tuscany tops all communities in the city with 42 single-family home sales through the first two months of 2015.
Southeast Calgary was the second busiest quadrant for resale activity in February. The quadrant is represented in Zone D, where 212 homes changed hands. Most of the sales in this area came through McKenzie Towne at 23 deals along with Cranston and McKenzie Lake with 17 sales each.
The benchmark price in the zone last month was $499,900, up six per cent from February 2014.
Southwest Calgary saw the sharpest decline in resale numbers last month. Zone C, which translates to the zone, had 159 sales. This marked a 47 per cent pullback from a year earlier. With that said, the benchmark price grew five per cent to $622,200.
Bridlewood's 15 sales and 14 transactions in Evergreen were the most active in southwest Calgary in February.
Northeast Calgary, which is shown in Zone B, saw 115 singlefamily homes change hands last month. The benchmark price on these homes was $380,400, which is nine per cent pricier than the same month a year ago. Pacing the area was Martindale's 14 sales and 12 in Saddle Ridge.

"Resale prices on single-family homes in April were the lowest in 11 months, says the 
Calgary Real Estate Board
.
Single-family homes in Calgary sold for a benchmark price of $510,200 last month. The last time that price was lower was May 2014 when it was $508,300. Benchmark prices are that of a typical home based on a formula that uses various factors to ensure accurate comparisons.
""While conditions continue to favour the buyer, both the months of supply and the sales to new listings ratio, which represent measures of market balance, tightened in April,"" CREB chief economist Ann-Marie Lurie says. ""If this trend continues, it should help prevent resale inventories from rising to previous highs and limit some of the downward price pressures we've been seeing.""
The month's supply measure of inventory was 2.63 in April, down from 3.19 in March and 3.99 in February. Last month, 1,774 single-family homes were added to the market, which is a 21 per cent downswing from 2,254 new listings a year earlier.
Sales activity of single-family homes also saw a setback in April. There were 1,149 transactions last month, down from 1,533 during the same month in 2014. However, last month's resale figures were the strongest since October of last year when 1,290 single-family homes changed hands.
Most of last month's sales came from the $400,000-$449,999 price bracket, where 213 homes changed hands. Next was the $450,000-$499,999 range with 169 deals.
Meanwhile, sales cooled in the higher-price bracket. There were 49 single-family homes sold for at least $1 million in April compared to 87 during the same time in 2014.
""Higher priced properties in the detached sector saw a noticeable decline in absorption levels citywide, indicating there is less demand relative to supply levels,"" Lurie says. ""This does not come as a surprise as many of the job losses in recent months have occurred in the higher paying sectors.""
Leading last month's singlefamily home sales was the northwest end of the city. Zone A, which roughly covers the quadrant, saw 371 sales in April. Homes in this zone sold for at a benchmark price of $518,700. Coventry Hills and Panorama Hills led the quadrant in sales with 27 and 22 deals, respectively.
Zone D, which translates to southeast Calgary, had 292 sales last month with a benchmark price of $495,900. Its busiest communities for sales included 28 in Copperfield, 24 in Cranston, 23 at McKenzie Lake and 22 in New Brighton.
On the southwest end of the city, 285 homes changed hands with a benchmark price of $610,500. This quadrant is shown in Zone C. Leading this quadrant were Evergreen's 22 deals and Bridlewood's 21.
Zone B, covering Calgary's northeast side, had 201 sales with the lowest benchmark price in the city at $384,800. Saddle Ridge topped the quadrant with 26 deals, followed by 18 in Martindale and Falconridge's 14.

"People who sold a single-family home on Calgary's resale market in October received about $3,400 less than similar listings a year earlier.
The benchmark price on singlefamily homes was $513,800 last month, a 0.6 per cent downtick from $517,200 in October 2014, says the Calgary Real Estate Board. Benchmark prices are that of a typical home based on a formula that uses various factors to ensure accurate comparisons.
Last month's price was the lowest in the city since $512,800 in May.
""In this type of market, both sellers and buyers need to have those hard discussions with their real estate professionals about their objectives,"" says CREB president Corinne Lyall. She says there's been bolstered competition in the rental and new home markets.
""If sellers are serious about selling, they need to consider how they are positioning their home on the market. Buyers, meanwhile, have to consider whether that home satisfies their lifestyle needs,"" Lyall says.
October also saw resale activity of single-family homes slip 32 per cent and new listings come down by 11 per cent. Inventory of singlefamily homes on the resale market in October reached 2,922 listings, which is a 15 per cent hike from 2,540 homes a year ago.
""Persistent weakness in the overall economy continued to impact housing demand in Calgary as October sales were nearly 16 per cent below long-term averages,"" says CREB chief economist Ann-Marie Lurie on average resale figures. ""In addition, new listings did not decline enough to prevent inventory gains and, ultimately, price contractions.""
With that said, activity hasn't been equal across the various segments and price points. Demand relative to supply has been ""balanced to tight"" in lower price bands, Lurie says.
""Months of supply are naturally higher in the upper price ranges, but what I look at is the shifts, and we can see that there has been a large gain in the higher end of the market,"" she adds. ""At the same time, the sales to new listings ratio is falling in the higher ranges. With more imbalance at the higher ranges, this can have a greater impact on pricing than what would be expected in the lower price ranges."" The only area of Calgary to see an increase in benchmark price on single-family homes in October compared to the same time in 2014 was the northeast quadrant. Calgary's northeast, which is largely shown in Zone B, recorded a five per cent gain to a benchmark of $396,600.
""Months of supply has remained fairly tight in this market, ranging from a high of 3.53 in January to low of 1.36 months in May,"" Lurie says of Zone B. ""The majority of the homes sold in this district are priced below $500,000 the segment of the market that is remaining relatively tight, supporting price gains. "" Zone B had the fewest sales in the city last month with 141 transactions. It was led by Martindale with 19 and 11 in Taradale.

Zone A's benchmark price in October was $520,000, which is two per cent less than the same month in 2014.
Zone D, which covers southeast Calgary, notched 231 single-family home sales in October. Its benchmark price eased one per cent yearover-year to $498,000. The zone's busiest communities for resale include 25 in Cranston and 21 in New Brighton.
