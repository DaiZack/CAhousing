On a national level, home prices should see \u201chealthy appreciation by the end of 2020,\" according to \nRoyal LePage\n's forecast, which sees the aggregate home price rising 3.2 per cent on an annual basis to $669,800 over the year to come.\nAlthough that kind of expected price growth eclipses Winnipeg's forecast, Froese focused on what he considers the positives in Winnipeg's real estate outlook: demand remains high, he said, and the local economy is diverse with a growing workforce and high levels of consumer confidence and home affordability.\n\u201cThose things are going to drive sales \u2014 as well, immigration, population increases, those are all positive signs for numbers actually trending upward,\" he said.\nFroese warned against painting the entire Winnipeg real estate market with the same brush. He said certain neighbourhoods and market segments with lower housing supply do experience multiple offers and bidding wars that drive prices up.\nHe said Winnipeg condo prices are expected to increase in 2020.\n\u201cWhere supply has outpaced sales in housing, condo sales have outpaced inventory, so that's why we're seeing a bit more positive increase there... It's been a positive year for condos, and we expect more of the same,\" Froese said.\nKnow of any newsworthy developments in the local residential, commercial or industrial real estate sectors?

{"title": "Mom wonders if buying daughter a condo for school will impact retirement goal; Monthly Retirement Income At Age 61 $6,432; Personal Finance", "date": "21 December 2019", "Journal": "Vancouver Sun", "author": "Andrew Allentuck", "wordscount": "1011", "content": "A teacher in British Columbia who we'll call Jane is helping support her daughter, Kim, through university. Now 50, Jane brings home $4,797 per month from her job and adds modest rental income from condos in B.C. and Quebec.\nJane purchased the Quebec condo, which she mortgaged her previously debtfree home to buy, so that Kim would have a place to stay at school. Kim pays rent that covers the $1,229 monthly mortgage payment - below the going rate for comparable units - but that doesn't include the costs of insurance, property taxes and maintenance.\nJane worries the condo purchase may have hindered her retirement. Family Finance asked Caroline Nalbantoglu, head of CNal Financial Planning Inc. in Montreal, to work with Jane.\nFINANCIAL PICTURE The significant debts Jane is now carrying are the biggest issue threatening her retirement. In addition to a $300,000 mortgage on the Quebec condo, Jane owes $62,305 on her B.C. condo, which is an investment property.\nShe pays 3.35 per cent interest on the B.C. mortgage, which works out to $600 month, plus an additional $300 in condo fees and taxes. Those costs, subtracted from gross rental income of $1,700 per month, leave her with net pre-tax return of $800 per month or $9,600 per year.\nUsing an estimated current value of $389,000 and deducting her debt, her equity in the unit is about $326,700. The annual return on that equity is three per cent, not a lot for the trouble, but acceptable.\nMortgage payments on the Quebec unit are about $1,220 - covered by Kim's rent - so Jane incurs a loss of about $575, the amount of the additional costs.\nWhen Kim graduates in a year, however, Jane can charge market rent of $2,500 per month and will wind up with positive income of $695 per month, making it a profitable investment. Rising interest rates could thwart that.\nHer total financial assets, excluding $13,000 in RESPs for Kim that will be used up this year, are $251,200. RETIREMENT INCOME Jane is targeting retirement income of $5,000 per month after tax.\nThe core of that will come from a substantial defined-benefit pension with three options. Retirement at 55 would provide $2,248 per month and a $422 bridge to 65, total $2,670. Retirement at 61 would have a $3,620 monthly base plus a $495 bridge to 65, total $4,115. Retirement at 65 would have a $5,013 monthly pension payment with no bridge When to retire is the issue.\nRetirement at 55 is too punitive, Nalbantoglu explains. She would take a massive cut in her pension for life. \"Unless she really wants out, I would not suggest retirement at 55,\" the planner says.\nRetirement at 61 is acceptable. Jane's income would consist of a $4,115 monthly pension including a $495 monthly bridge to 65, rental income of $1,495 per month or $17,940 per year, and reduced Canada Pension Plan benefits of $822 per month. That adds up to $6,432 per month or $77,184 per year.\nJane's TFSA balance, $61,000 at present and growing with $3,840 contributions per year at three per cent after inflation for of 11 years, would become $133,620 at her age 61. Annuitized to pay out all income and capital in the following 34 years to her age 95, she would get $512 per month or $6,140 per year. The TFSA payments would boost annual income to $83,324 per year. With no tax on TFSA payouts and 20 per cent average tax on the balance, she would have $5,657 per month to spend. That's over her $5,000 minimum retirement income target.\nAt 65, she would lose her $495 monthly pension bridge but add about $600 per month in \nOld Age Security\n, leaving her with about $5,745 per month after tax.\nADDING RRIF INCOME\nAt 71, Jane would have to convert her RRSP to a Registered Retirement Income Fund and start taking money out at 72. Her RRSP balance, $105,000 at present, would grow at an estimated three per cent after inflation with present $4,560 annual additions boosted to $6,000 per year for 11 years to retirement at 61 to $224,500 then grow at the same rate with no further contributions for 10 more years to her age 71 with no further contributions to $301,715.\nSet to pay out all income and principal for the following 24 years to her age 95, she would get $17,300 per year. Her total income would be $101,962. With no tax on TFSA cash flow and 22 per cent average tax, less a charge from the \nOAS\n clawback, she'll have $78,146 per year or $6,512 per month. Jane's generosity will not have left her short of her retirement income goal. If the Quebec condo appreciates, she can make further gifts to Kim or good causes with her surplus.\nFinancial Post e-mail andrew.allentuck@gmail.com for a free Family Finance analysis MONTHLY SPENDING SNAPSHOT\nReal Estate Mortgages .......................... $1,829 Property taxes ......................$491 Rental condo fees/costs ..... $985 Personal Food and restaurant ............$400 Home and car insurance ...... $210 Charity and gifts .................... $80 Clothing & grooming ..............$50 Entertainment and travel ......$175 Transport Car fuel, repairs .................... $281 Other basics Phones, internet, utilities ..... $277 Financial RRSP .....................................$380 TFSA ......................................$320 Life insurance ........................$119 Expenses. ......................... .$5,597 BIG PICTURE FINANCIALS\nAssets House ............................ $441,000 Condo BC ......................$389,000 Condo Que ................... $300,000 TFSA ................................ $61,000 RRSPs ........................... $105,000 Non-registered ............... $85,200 RESP ................................$13,000 Car ..................................... $4,000 Total Assets .............. $1,398,200 Liabilities Mortgage Que .............. $300,000 Mortgage BC ...................$62,305 Net Worth .................$ 1,035,895 RETIREMENT READINESS"},
{"title": "Housing starts continue to outpace local demand", "date": "21 December 2019", "Journal": "Edmonton Journal", "author": "Joel Schlesinger", "wordscount": "538", "content": "Housing options continued to grow in Edmonton over the course of 2019 with little sign of slowing down, based on recent starts data.\n\n\nCanada Mortgage and Housing Corp\n. released its market report for December (data up to the end of November) showing Edmonton starts were up year to date relative to 2018, \"an increase of six per cent,\" says Pershing Sun, senior analyst at CMHC.\nShe adds the rise is mostly accounted for by growth in the multi-family segment. Starts were up 26 per cent year to date, while single-family detached home starts for the first 11 months of 2019 were down 15 per cent compared with the same span the year before.\n\"Yet the main story in Edmonton is inventory remains high, has been quite elevated for a while and keeps growing,\" Sun says. \"In addition, what we have for the first three quarters of 2019 is most of the absorption has happened in the multi-family segment.\"\nDespite rising activity in this segment, Edmonton remains a buyer's market and should remain one into the new year and beyond, she adds.\nThis is especially the case on the single-detached side of the market for new homes. All told, Alberta's inventory of unsold product was about 5,300 at the end of November.\n\"Edmonton accounts for more than half of inventory in the province,\" she says, adding the city has about 2,900 unabsorbed units.\n\"And more than half of Edmonton's inventory consists of single-family detached homes.\"\nSun adds multi-family sales have been stronger in the city because it is often the entry level option.\nShe notes some of the growth may be a result of rising provincial migration, nearly 13,000 (as of Sept. 30) compared with just over 9,000 people for the same period in 2018.\nThe caveat with this figure, she notes, is many migrants are likely moving to Calgary, which has stronger job growth (up more than four per cent year to date). By comparison, Edmonton's employment growth has stagnated and was down in November by 1.5 per cent over the same month last year.\n\"The job market was looking positive in 2018 ... but since January this year, unemployment has been on an upward trend,\" she says.\n\"Based on overall economic conditions, I would say that Edmonton is not recovering as well as Calgary.\"\nHeading into 2020, the expectation is for modest growth in new starts - or moderate overbuilding - that should taper off into 2021.\n\"We believe prices might trend lower over the next year and a half or even two years,\" Sun adds.\nThe reason being that the key driver - the job market - is not expected to expand significantly, continuing with the trend of the past year.\n\"Compared with Calgary, the job market has not been as positive and population growth has slowed down, so demand is not expected to shoot up in Edmonton in the short run.\"\nYet Sun notes conditions will likely remain favourable for individuals with steady, full-time work seeking to buy a home.\n\"It's definitely going to be a buyer's market in 2020.\""},

{"title": "Forecast optimistic for Manitoba homebuilders", "date": "21 December 2019", "Journal": "Winnipeg Free Press", "author": "Lanny McInnes", "wordscount": "481", "content": "Recent housing reports and economic projections for 2020 are providing Manitoba's residential construction industry with some optimism for the upcoming year. This is welcome news following two years of declining single-family housing starts and challenging market conditions.\nAccording to the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), housing starts in Manitoba at the end of November were down eight per cent overall compared to the same time frame in 2018. Single-family housing starts were 12 per cent lower than in 2018, and multi-family starts were six per cent lower than in 2018. Manitoba, especially Winnipeg, had seen significant growth in purpose-built rental apartments and multi-family condos in 2018 and early 2019. CMHC numbers would indicate this trend slowed considerably in the latter half of 2019. The impact of the federal mortgage rules, slower immigration numbers and slower economic growth all had an impact on overall housing starts over the past 12 months.\nHowever, recent reports show a growing level of optimism in Manitoba's new-home construction market. Re/Max's 2020 market outlook for Winnipeg forecasts a balanced housing market, with the average residential sales price expected to grow by two per cent in 2020, with move-up buyers and first-time buyers entering the market at a greater pace than in 2018 or 2019. This is welcome news for potential homebuyers, as other major Canadian cities are seeing housing prices forecast to rise at double or triple that rate. As well, Re/Max's report suggest more new Canadians will be looking for homes in Winnipeg, with immigration numbers expected to increase in 2020. This will mean an increased demand for all types of housing in Winnipeg.\nAccording to the Altus Group's latest housing report, demand for new single-family homes in Winnipeg will rebound in 2020, improving over 2019's results and slightly above the average our market has seen over the past 10 years. Altus Group forecasts Winnipeg will see 2,925 new single-family starts in 2020, up from the 2019 year end forecast of 2,400. At the same time, Altus Group is forecasting apartment starts will decrease by 150 starts compared to 2019. Both Altus Group and Re/Max are forecasting Winnipeg will maintain a four-month housing inventory throughout 2020, even with the expected increase in demand.\nThese reports suggest that while Winnipeg will experience an increased demand for new housing in 2020, new housing stock should be available to meet the increased demand. This will help keep our local housing market at a balanced level, even as our population continues to increase, and should help alleviate any potential sharp increases in the average price of buying a home, either new or resale, in Winnipeg over the next year.\nLanny McInnes is president of the Manitoba Home Builders' Association."},
{"title": "Things are looking up for real estate as resilience, recovery set to continue; But Murtaza Haider and Stephen Moranis warn that unknowns may disrupt outlook", "date": "20 December 2019", "Journal": "Ottawa Citizen", "author": "Murtaza Haider And Stephen Moranis", "wordscount": "882", "content": "After a disappointing 2018, when housing prices and sales declined, 2019 has been a year of resilience for housing markets across most of Canada. Not only did sales numbers stabilize and resume an upward climb, but prices also demonstrated some strength.\nAs we move closer to 2020, those involved with the real estate industry and the million-plus Canadian households who are likely to buy or sell a residential property in the next year are wondering whether things will continue to improve in the year ahead, or if there is more trouble in store.\nThe good news is that a review of the forecasts by leading real estate experts in Canada points to a recovery in 2020. The \nCanadian Real Estate Association\n (CREA) estimates the national home sales to reach 530,000 units in 2020, an 8.9-per-cent increase over the total expected for 2019. CREA also expects the national average price to hit $531,000 in 2020, a 6.2-per-cent increase.\n\n\nRoyal LePage\n, meanwhile, is predicting a 3.2-per-cent yearover-year increase in housing prices next year with RE/MAX a little more optimistic at 3.7 per cent. Though their benchmark prices are different from CREA, they see the market moving in the same direction.\nLikewise, a poll of 18 economists, conducted by Reuters in November, also saw gains ahead, predicting Canadian housing prices would rise by three per cent in 2020 and 2.9 per cent in 2021.\nThe positive forecast for housing markets in 2020 is supported by strong immigration numbers that are likely to maintain a sustained demand for housing in Canada's most populous housing markets. A \nRoyal LePage\n survey reported in October 2019 that \"newcomers to Canada are expected to purchase one in every five homes on the market over the next five years.\"\nAt the same time, CREA notes that the \nBank of Canada\n is unlikely to raise interest rates in 2020, which will drive demand for mortgage finance.\nWhile most market watchers are optimistic about housing, there are some causes for concern. For starters, not everyone expects a three-plus per cent jump in prices. \nFitch Ratings\n, a debt assessment firm, is forecasting a mere one-per-cent growth in housing prices in 2020. When adjusted for two-per-cent inflation, Fitch is forecasting a decline in real house prices for the next year.\nAnother concern is that listings are not keeping pace with sales. An increase in new listings, when sales are climbing, is needed to restrict inflationary pressures. Royal Lepage, in its forecast for 2020, is also mindful of a lack of growth in listings. \"The story in 2020 will be lack of supply,\" warns the real estate firm.\nAccompanying the tightened supply is growth in mortgage credit. This has caught the attention of the \nBank of Canada\n. In a recent address, Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor of the bank, noted that a drop in mortgage rates had \"boosted\" the markets. \"Many of the same ingredients that were present in some housing markets three years ago - namely strong underlying demand, tight supply and low-interest rates - are present again,\" she noted.\nDespite the concerns, markets are better equipped to deal with the determinants of inflationary pressures. The \nBank of Canada\n expects \"the regulatory and other measures in place will support the quality of new credit and mitigate the buildup of imbalances in the housing market.\"\nThe regulatory measure credited the most with addressing housing price inflation is the stress test, which was expanded in January 2018 to include uninsured mortgages and required borrowers to qualify at a higher rate than the negotiated rate with the lender to address the possibility of a future rate hike.\nWhile Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has directed his Finance Minister, Bill Morneau to review the tests and potentially make them more dynamic, it is not certain if or precisely how that will happen. Any changes will have to balance the needs of Alberta and the Prairies, where housing markets have been struggling, with those of regions where demand has already started to pick up.\nAll told, a vibrant labour market, vigorous demand for housing and low interest rates suggest conditions will be favourable for housing in 2020. The federal government's initiative to help new homebuyers with shared equity mortgages and a possible review of the stress test are also positive signs. But as always in real estate, there are plenty of unknowns that could disrupt that positive picture. Financial Post Murtaza Haider is a professor of Real Estate Management at \nRyerson University\n.

{"title": "Saving up to buy your first home? Here's why you should do it in a TFSA instead of an RRSP", "date": "19 December 2019", "Journal": "Hamilton Spectator", "author": "", "wordscount": "788", "content": "Coming up with a down payment can be a monumental challenge for first-time home buyers. With soaring Canadian real estate prices, crippling student loan debt, and low entry-level salaries, it can take years to save the required minimum down payment of five per cent.\nGiven the amount of time you'll be saving, the question of where to park your down payment fund is important. Naturally, you'll want it to grow tax-free, which means you have two options: One is a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), which will allow you to participate in the Home Buyers' Plan. Another option is a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), which allows for more flexible contributions and withdrawals.\nWhich is better? For most first-time home buyers, a TFSA works best. Let's have a closer look at each below.\nUsing an RRSP\nIf you save up for your down payment in your RRSP, you can use the Home Buyers' Plan (HBP) to withdraw up to $35,000 as a loan without paying tax on the withdrawal. Only first-time home buyers are eligible to use the HBP, unless special rules for persons with disabilities apply.\nTechnically, you are considered a first-time homebuyer if neither you nor your spouse owned a home during the four calendar years prior to the year of withdrawal, and up to 30 days before the withdrawal.\nLoan repayment under the HBP must take place over a period of 15 years, or less if desired. The repayments begin in the second year following the year of withdrawal. If the required repayment is not made, an amount will have to be included as taxable income in the year of the shortfall.\nIf you have previously participated in the HBP, there are certain situations in which you may be able to access it a second time. First of all, the full amount previously withdrawn must be paid back into your RRSP before the beginning of the year that you want to participate a second time. Also, you must still qualify as a first-time homebuyer.\nIf you contribute an amount to your RRSP, you can't make a withdrawal under the HBP within 90 days of that contribution, or your ability to claim a deduction for the contribution may be restricted.\nAs a general rule, you should make your RRSP contribution more than 90 days before the withdrawal. After a waiting period of 90 days or more, your deduction may generate a tax refund, which can also be applied toward your down payment.\nEach spouse or common-law partner can withdraw eligible amounts from their RRSPs under the HBP.

While Fitch expects the \nBank of Canada\n to keep interest rates at 1.75 per cent through next year, an increase to 2 per cent in 2021 and ensuing higher rates could strain the ability of Canadians to repay debt, it said.\nAffordability could be most stressed in Toronto and in the Vancouver market, where \nRoyal LePage\n says the average two-storey detached house will cost $1.46 million next year, the most in Canada.\n\"Vancouver prices have been steadily declining since 2018 while Toronto prices briefly stalled before growing at a more modest 4 per cent in the year to September,\" Hosterman said.\nStill, Fitch expects mortgage arrears to remain near historic lows, at 0.3 per cent next year, as homeowners are bolstered by low unemployment at 5.7 per cent, solid job growth and rising wages.\nCompared to 23 other countries in the outlook, Fitch's forecast for house price growth in Canada comes in near the bottom, second lowest only to Italy at a 0.5 per cent increase. Colombia is highest at 7 per cent; U.S. house prices are predicted to grow at 3 per cent next year. Canada and the U.K. are the only countries to be rated stable/negative in an overall market evaluation, while all the rest are assessed stable.\nThe growth of mortgages will likewise be low next year at 1 per cent, Fitch forecasts, as qualification standards for loans remain stringent. In contrast, mortgage activity in the U.S. may fall by 5 per cent as refinancing slows, Fitch said.\nIt noted how the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corp., the country's largest public mortgage backer, is reducing its role in the market with about 20 per cent fewer loans qualifying for government insurance because of tighter restrictions. A CMHC program to help first-time buyers in meeting equity requirements may help boost the market a bit, the ratings company said.\n\"While this should help make home ownership more affordable, buyers are still subject to tighter standards imposed by the government,\" Fitch said."},

With soaring Canadian real estate prices, crippling student loan debt, and low entry-level salaries, it can take years to save the required minimum down payment of five per cent.\nGiven the amount of time you'll be saving, the question of where to park your down payment fund is important. Naturally, you'll want it to grow tax-free, which means you have two options: One is a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), . Another option is a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA).\nWhich is better? For most first-time home buyers, a TFSA works best.\nUsing an RRSP\nIf you save up for your down payment in your RRSP, you can use the Home Buyers' Plan (HBP) to withdraw up to $35,000 as a loan without paying tax on the withdrawal. Only first-time home buyers are eligible to use the HBP, unless special rules for persons with disabilities apply.\nLoan repayment under the HBP must take place over a period of 15 years, or less if desired. The repayments begin in the second year following the year of withdrawal. If the required repayment is not made, an amount will have to be included as taxable income in the year of the shortfall.\nIf you contribute an amount to your RRSP, you can't make a withdrawal under the HBP within 90 days of that contribution, or your ability to claim a deduction for the contribution may be restricted.\nAs a general rule, you should make your RRSP contribution more than 90 days before the withdrawal. After a waiting period of 90 days or more, your deduction may generate a tax refund, which can also be applied toward your down payment.\nEach spouse or common-law partner can withdraw eligible amounts from their RRSPs under the HBP. This also means that each person may withdraw up to the $35,000 limit, or $70,000 total (if purchasing the property jointly).\nUsing a TFSA\nThe TFSA is a registered plan like an RRSP, but differs because TFSA contributions are not tax deductible.

Additionally, 14 per cent noted they cannot buy because they do not qualify for a mortgage, while another 14 per cent are currently repairing their credit score.\nAs well, 12 per cent of respondents indicated a lack of affordable options keeping them out of the market.\nAffordability is key factor why many Canadians choose to rent.\nAlmost 75 per cent of those surveyed stated rents were within their budget. While the survey did not provide regional data, Edmonton average rents have remained steady since 2014. At the time, a two-bedroom average rent was $1,229 a month, provincial government data show. This year, the average rent is about $1,280, according to rental.ca.\nAdditionally, 2019's vacancy is 3.9 per cent, according to Canada Mortgage and Housing estimates, twice as high as 2014, when vacancy was just 1.7 per cent.\nOverall, conditions are supportive for renters in the city's marketplace. A survey from Urban Analytics from earlier this fall showed growing rental options, due to new product coming onto the market.\nConsequently, it found rents across the city have been decreasing, including two-bedrooms by more than seven per cent in the third quarter compared with the second quarter of 2019.\nFurthermore, home prices continue to fall in Edmonton with the average price dropping 2.32 per cent year over year in November.\nAs such, renters are experiencing a best-of-both-worlds scenario in the city, King adds. Renters have plenty of choice among rental units, and they are seeing good pricing and selection for home ownership.\nDespite Edmonton being a buyer's market, King cautions adverse economic conditions - as result of the ongoing slump in the oil and gas industry - continue to affect buyer confidence.\n\"But for those who feel secure about their job, it would be then an excellent time to get into the market because housing prices are lower compared with the rest of Canada.\""},

In contrast, 2018 saw land deals rise by 17 per cent, year over year.\n\"We also saw a huge number of new multi-family projects launch in 2018.\"\nHe notes 26 projects launched in just one quarter last year.\n\"That brought a lot of supply to the market, which means developers weren't looking to buy more land this year because they already have active positions in the market today.\"\nAmong those bright spots, however, are an increase in multi-family rental apartment deals.\n\"We have seen purpose-built multi-family apartment (rentals) continue to be a very attractive investment, and the (sales) volumes are up across every market in Canada, including Calgary,\" he says.\nTransactions more than doubled in the city for the first half of the year compared with 2018.\nAll told the deals were worth roughly $200 million.\n\"One driver is there has been more purpose-built rental construction and, in turn, there are now more investment opportunities that weren't there the year before,\" Boukall says.\nReal estate investment trusts (REITs) drove sales.\nMinto Apartment GP Inc.'s acquisition of the Quarters in the southeast was the largest.\nThe $68-million deal accounted for almost one-third of activity in the multi-family rental segment.\nAnother green shoot in the market was industrial property with deals this year worth almost $400 million. That's a jump of 25 per cent over last year.\nWhile the transactions do not directly affect the city's residential market, the deal flow does point to confidence in Calgary's economy.\nBoukall further notes the economy is showing other signs of improvement, including net migration growth.\nOver the last year, close to 10,000 people came to the city, which helps drive demand for rental units, he adds.\n\"Consequently, apartments are seen as an attractive investment, and there is still opportunity for rent growth, which tends to rise with inflation and wages.\"\nConversely, new multi-family condominium sales were down.\nBoukall explains fewer new launches of product this year led to lower activity.\n\"If there is nothing new to buy, sales will usually be down.\"\nThe apartment condominium dragged down multi-family sales overall.

Factors in an appraisal report - such as the square footage of the structure, its overall condition, the number of bathrooms and bedrooms and things such as an inclusion of a pool or fireplace - will provide an assessment for financial lenders.\nIt may also serve as an additional tool for potential buyers regarding a property's value.

As a result, average home prices in both cities are approaching $1 million, extinguishing the dream of home ownership for many young people.\nNot for the first time, politicians reacted to this affordability crisis by scapegoating a small group of people who don't vote in elections; non-residents living abroad who buy homes in Canada fit this bill perfectly. British Columbia introduced a 15 per cent tax on non-resident property purchases in April 2016, matched by Ontario in April 2017.\nUnfortunately, taxing or even banning non-residents from buying homes hardly addresses the real reasons behind soaring house prices and in practice is not likely to be easily enforceable.\nWhat is driving the surge in homes prices? Consider its origins. House prices were stable in Vancouver and rising moderately in Toronto leading up to 2015. Prices took off starting in 2015 when two things happened simultaneously as a result of the crash in oil prices:\nFirst, the \nBank of Canada\n cut interest rates, making house buying more attractive to all Canadians;\nSecond, the influx of immigrants became more concentrated in Toronto and Vancouver because the economy weakened in the oil-producing provinces. As a result, demand for housing in these two cities accelerated.\nNon-residents were not to blame for the sudden rise in demand beginning in 2015. \nStatsCan\n data show that non-residents appear to own only 3.4 per cent of properties in Toronto and 4.8 per cent in Vancouver, skewed more to the market for condos than single-family homes. The \nBank of Canada\n's interest rate cut and the concentration of immigrant flows in Vancouver and Toronto were what fuelled demand, not non-resident purchases.\nNormally, a surge in prices would eventually self-correct by drawing more supply into the market. However, this mechanism was short-circuited by misguided provincial and municipal policies, including zoning regulations and rent controls that limited the ability of builders to boost supply to meet higher demand. The inevitable result of surging demand and limited supply was soaring home prices.\nEven if we wanted to finger non-residents as a major source of rising demand, taxing home purchases by non-residents or banning them altogether is not the solution. It is hard to design a tax or ban that would be effective.\nA small tax does not discourage non-residents from buying in a market where prices are soaring anyway and where the Canadian dollar price looks cheap to people in other countries because of the devalued loonie.\nA large tax or outright ban gives non-residents a major incentive to find a Canadian to pose as the buyer and then rent or give the property back to the ultimate buyer abroad (especially if the Canadian resident posing as the buyer is a relative already in Canada to study or work).\nThe only sustainable long-term solution to soaring home prices in Toronto and Vancouver is to loosen the regulations stifling supply - a process underway at least in Ontario - while reining in demand.\nThe ideal way to check demand is raising domestic interest rates or boosting the exchange rate to increase the Canadian dollar price to non-residents. However, the \nBank of Canada\n is reluctant to do either because it does not want to raise the exchange rate and smother a recovery in manufacturing exports it hopes will offset lower oil prices.\nRather than normalizing interest rates, various levels of government have tried to restrain demand with a grab bag of policies including tougher mortgage regulations (deeply resented by Canadians living outside of Toronto or Vancouver) and taxes on non-resident home purchases and vacant homes.\nEven then, housing policies often work at cross-purposes, as the federal government also increased the incentives for first-time buyers to purchase homes even while impeding other sources of finance. The result was a band-aid solution that only capped prices at a level that leaves housing unaffordable to the next generation of prospective homeowners.\nRestricting non-resident purchases has proven difficult to enforce without addressing the fundamental sources of the imbalance between surging demand and lagging supply in English Canada's two most populous cities.\n\nPhilip Cross is a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute."},

As well, months of supply was down by nearly 10 per cent.\n\"But it will take time before we see more stability in pricing,\" she says.\nThe benchmark price for the city fell to $419,000 in November compared with $429,000 for the same month last year, consistent with the trend for first 10 months of 2019. Although the benchmark price decreased by 2.31 per cent, the median price did rise year over year by 0.85 per cent in November. But Lurie notes this metric a less important number than the benchmark, which excludes the outliers (highest and lowest priced homes) to provide a more accurate reflection of prices in Calgary.\n\"Yet even with respect to the median prices, on a year to date basis, they're still down,\" she says referring to a drop of 2.84 per cent ending last month, compared with the same span in 2018.\nAs for sales, the pullback in November was \"driven by the apartment\" segment falling 21 per cent, Lurie explains.\nDespite resales falling overall, single-family detached home sales rose more than four per cent and attached segment moved up by almost four per cent, compared with November 2018. Lurie notes the attached segment has been the standout performer this year.\n\"It has really outperformed expectations,\" she says. \"That sector has grown by six per cent for sales on a year to date basis.\"\nSales growth is due to growing demand for affordable housing options, Lurie adds. Townhomes are a natural fit in this respect - the middle ground between apartment condominiums and single-detached homes.\nDespite the segment's strength, the resale market is still struggling with oversupply across all segments, especially by historical measures.\nEven though months of supply were down last month compared with the same month last year (5.58 versus 5.05 months), the figure remains a far cry from the peak in 2014 when supply was about two months. \"So we're still in buyers'market conditions,\" Lurie says, adding the lower priced options are generally faring better than homes at $500,000 and over.\nOf the 1,160 sales in November, more than 80 per cent occurred in the under $500,000 segment.\nOutlying areas - Airdrie, Cochrane and Okotoks - experienced similar trends in November, she says.\nAirdrie, for instance, saw improving sales activity and falling listings. But like other areas in and around Calgary, economic uncertainty weighs heavily on the market. Lurie says the good news is further bumps in the economy are less likely to affect the market dramatically as buyers have already grown used to conditions.\n\"The market has been continuously and slowly adjusting,\" Lurie says. \"It's certainly not a quick recovery, but at least we're starting to see things level out near the bottom.\""},
{"title": "Edmonton Real Estate Ripe For Investment; The market is a good one for first-time buyers and those looking to move up to a pricier home, Dennis Faulkner writes", "date": "7 December 2019", "Journal": "Edmonton Journal", "author": "Dennis Faulkner", "wordscount": "795", "content": "It has been more than five years since the fall of world oil prices, and Alberta is still contributing significantly to the rest of the country. What I find a little surprising is that our market for single-family homes held up so well.\nWe had so much momentum in 2014 that our single-family home prices did not peak until a year later. In the spring of 2015, the average selling price in greater Edmonton region was $450,000. This summer, we were hovering around $430,000. That's only a little over a four-per-cent fall, and I would argue that this fall was a result of the stress test, not the economy. The economy stalled our growth in single-family, but it was the stress test that caused the backslide.\nOvernight, due to the stress test introduced in 2017, our purchasing power was reduced by about 25 per cent. So if you could qualify for a $400,000 home before, now you could only qualify for a $300,000 home. That is a huge difference and many put off their home purchases for that reason alone.\nThe condo market has been different. If you purchased a single-family home in 2007 for $400,000, that home today is worth about the same. However, if you purchased a condo in 2007 for $400,000, that condo today is worth about $260,000.\nI think this can be explained, at least in part, by looking at our demographics. I believe we are quite different from the rest of Canada with respect to our housing needs. It is typically younger and older Canadians who live in condos.\nThe demographics of the young in Alberta compared to the rest of Canada are skewed somewhat with a higher percentage of youth in the resource industry, which pays a higher average wage. More of these youth are likely to have families or more vehicles/toys that cannot be easily accommodated in a condo. When we retire in this province, many of us don't stay. We may be here for only our working career and we may retire where we were born or perhaps to a warmer climate. For these reasons, I believe, there is likely less demand for condos compared to other regions in Canada.\nHaving said that, I feel condos are priced right at this moment, and I no longer see them as a poor investment.\nSo, where does the market go from here? We are finally starting to see a reduction in the supply of available homes. In October, we had 17,391 active listings, down from 18,769 a year earlier. And it's noticeable. The availability of good quality, well-priced homes (including condos) is shrinking, especially when compared to the past two years.\nI personally believe this time is a great buying opportunity for investors. It's also a great opportunity for a first-time buyer or a move-up buyer, as the more pricey homes have fallen substantially more than the average home.\nThis year, we have worked with a few investors from Vancouver who are in sticker shock when they come to Edmonton. They see everything as a bargain. I believe we are seeing more activity as of late from investors (both local and international) who are quietly positioning themselves in our market. We, at least for now, have a very affordable housing market.\nCompared to this time last year, our homes are significantly cheaper, especially when you factor in the cost of a mortgage. Mortgage rates are about one per cent lower, making your mortgage payment much less. On a $400,000 mortgage, your payment would drop to about $1,830/month from about $2,040/month.\n\n\nThe Conference Board of Canada\n is projecting a better economy for Alberta in 2020. They are projecting that real GDP growth will bounce back in 2020 as the cuts to oil production come to an end and new pipeline and rail capacity allows for more normal oil production volumes.\nI honestly believe that history will demonstrate now is a great time to buy and invest in Alberta real estate. We are still a very affordable place to live."},

It will lead to more demand for those limited number of homes, pushing prices upward.\nAnd he noted that, even with the drop off late in the year, average prices are up by 5.5 per cent last month compared to November 2018.\nAnother issue, he said, is that many who want to buy starter homes are having difficulty qualifying for mortgages because of government rules that changed nearly two years ago.\n\"The ability of people to get a mortgage - that is our biggest challenge right now. A lot of qualified people are still having challenges qualifying for mortgages because of the existing rules, including the stress test,\" he said.\n\"People who should be able to buy are not able to buy. That affects movement at all levels,\" he said, by hampering the ability of people to sell their starter homes and buy more expensive homes.\nThat's not something that can be demonstrated in statistics produced by the board, Van de Vrande said, but it's something he has noticed on the street.\nThe federal government-imposed stress test, put in place in January of 2018, requires buyers to demonstrate they can manage higher mortgage payments if interest rates rise. The test is an effort to prevent homebuyers from getting into financial trouble.\nAnd it seems to have worked. Earlier this year the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corp. reported that mortgage delinquency rates across the country are at a record low, and Hamilton's rate is even lower than the national and provincial average.\nmmcneil@thespec.com\n905-526-4687 | @Markatthespec"},

A few of the notable changes that you should be aware of are:\n* Greater clarity for buyers and sellers so they know whether they are represented by a brokerage or if they are self-represented;\n* New and revised disclosures by salespeople and brokers, to buyers and sellers, to support informed decision making; and\n* Increased regulatory authority that will help RECO to fulfilling its consumer protection mandate.\nThe proposed legislation would also include updates to reflect changes in the marketplace, streamlined business processes for professionals in the industry, and \u2014 of highest priority to RECO \u2014 enhanced consumer protection for buyers and sellers throughout Ontario.\nI encourage you to visit reco.on.ca[https://www.reco.on.ca/] regularly for updates to the Trust in Real Estate Services Act, 2019 and what it means to consumers.

Renters in St. John's are the most satisfied.\nConducted as part of the national housing strategy, the 2018 Canadian Housing Survey shows satisfaction with affordability in particular at just 48 per cent in Toronto, where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment tops $2,300. Renters in St. John's scored much higher on affordability, at 75 per cent satisfied.\nAmid high prices in Toronto and strong population growth, the data also reveals that 20 per cent of rental households that are not social housing or affordable housing rated their accommodation as \"unsuitable\" in 2018 because the dwelling does not have enough bedrooms \"for the size and composition of the household.\"\n\"It's a function of developers building smaller and smaller units,\" said Condos.ca co-founder Andrew Harrild, referring to \nCanada Mortgage and Housing Corp\n. data showing one-third of Toronto-area condos are rentals.\nHe said condo developers are catering to investors who are renting units to buyers who have to compromise on space in order to live in an expensive city, adding that condo sizes are generally larger outside of the downtown core.\nCondo apartment unit average sizes have fallen to just over 900 square feet at the end of October from about 925 square feet in 2016 according to a report from the \nAltus Group\n, a Toronto-based commercial real estate services firm.

Despite recent monthly statistics from the Realtors Association of Edmonton showing prices falling by eight per cent last month compared with October 2018, a market analyst sees upside in the city for patient investors and home buyers.\n\"It's in recovery - a slow recovery - that's based on current and future GDP growth,\" says Jennifer Hunt, vice-president of research at Real Estate Intelligence Network Ltd. \"At REIN we are always looking at the health of the economy, jobs and migration.\"\nAll are connected, she adds.\nEconomic growth creates jobs, which boosts migration. In turn, more people coming to the city for jobs will create more demand for housing - first rental units and then homes for ownership.\nIndeed, the City of Edmonton's recent economic update for November shows positive growth for 2019. Real GDP - net of inflation - is expected to be about 0.5 per cent this year.\nThat's higher than Calgary, which is forecast to contract slightly at -0.4 per cent.\nFurthermore, growth will accelerate into 2020 forecast at about 1.4 per cent.\nWhile growth rates are expected to be below the economic expansion seen between 2010 and 2014, real estate data already shows the market gaining momentum with sales rising by six per cent in October, compared with the same month in 2018.\nAll this points to Edmonton, Hunt notes, being fertile ground for real estate investors. She further points to REIN's Top 10 Towns and Cities in Alberta (released at the end of September) that ranked the city at the top of all major municipalities (with Calgary in second spot).\n\"As we move into a recovery, it's still a good time to buy and hold in the market,\" she says.\nPrices may be still slumping for the most part, but migration is picking up. Alberta net migration in the second quarter of 2019 was 12,899 compared with 9,189 for April to June of 2018, an increase of more than 40 per cent. Additionally, she says buyers can look to localized factors, like a property's proximity to transportation, data metrics REIN includes in its Edmonton Transportation Effect Report, released in the fall of 2018.\nThe reports found, for instance, transportation infrastructure delivers a 10-to 20-per-cent premium on real estate values within 800 metres of an LRT station. As such, investors may want to look in the city's southeast around older neighbourhoods of Bonnie Doon, Strathearn and Holyrood, all located near the Valley Line Southeast - currently under construction.\nHunt cautions, however, the recovery remains tenuous and subject to setbacks, particularly from policy decisions.\nThat's why she argues it's important for buyers to pay attention to politics, including recent decisions by city council regarding the transportation budget for LRT expansion.\n\"Homebuyers and real estate investors always want to make sure they're staying on top of these decisions because politics and policies can have an impact on real estate, price-wise.\""},

But security is just as important. You are wise to keep it top of mind.\nThere are a few steps you can take to help remove the temptation for would-be thieves. Before the open house, have a conversation with your real estate representative about the potential risks. They'll be aware of the importance of personal and property safety, and can likely recommend additional measures to put in place during your open houses.\nIt is important to make security a part of the open house protocol. Doing so can reduce the potential for thieves to target your home. Speak with your salesperson about how they will monitor those who enter your home during showings and open houses. Some salespeople may require visitors to show a driver's licence, or other form of photo identification, before touring your home. This sends a clear message that you're keeping track of who enters the premises. Remember, it is your home, so you make the final decision regarding the steps to be followed to keep it secure.\nThieves know to look in closets and drawers, so valuable items should be placed somewhere secure - such as a safe. If possible, ask a trusted neighbour, friend or family member to store your valuable parcels during your open house.\nGifts and belongings are not all that are at risk of being stolen. It is important to secure your personal information, too. Keepingbank statements, credit card receipts, passports and confidential documentsout of sight, and out of reach, is a good practice.\nItems typically at risk of theft include:\nPortable electronics, including phones, tablets, laptops and portable speakers;\nJewelry and other valuable accessories, like watches;\nFamily heirlooms, including small pieces of artwork;\nPassports, bills and documents with personal information.\nAs security becomes a growing concern, there are other tools available to help safeguard our homes. For example, there are many kinds of in-home video surveillance devices and alarm systems that you can use to improve security.\nMost people visiting open houses are there to find a home - not to steal the belongings in it.

It had an open field to urge politicians to solve the affordability crisis by making it easier for the least creditworthy borrowers to get bigger mortgages. \"We are glad to see the parties are listening,\" Kevin Lee, the president of the Canadian Home Builders'Association, said in a news release in September.\nNow that the democratic process is over, Siddall has picked up his sword.\n\"I don't know why this debate is still happening,\" he told me in an interview at CMHC headquarters in Ottawa last week. \"And I don't know why people are vulnerable to it because it's just obvious that if you push prices higher, you're going to make the (affordability) problem worse.\"\nSiddall, who was appointed by Stephen Harper's government, has been called \"arrogant\" by Conservatives for describing in blunt terms that subsidizing debt helps builders and brokers, not buyers.\nIncentives such as the provision that allows first-time purchasers to withdraw from their Registered Retirement Savings Plans, the capital-gains-tax exemption on home sales, and reduced property-tax rates stoke demand and price inflation because so many urban markets are supply-constrained.\nUnder Siddall, CMHC has taken a step back, as per his mantra of using the agency's resources to support \"needs,\" not \"wants.\" According to the 2018 annual report, it had insured about 29 per cent of outstanding residential mortgages, compared with about 43 per cent in 2014.\nSiddall's priority these days is financing rental units, not juicing home-ownership rates.\n\"This glorification of home ownership is this odd North American thing that's counterproductive economically and socially,\" he said. \"If you are an owner versus a renter, (society) neglect(s) you,\" Siddall added.\n\"You are 75 times more likely to have severe food-insecurity issues if you are renter versus an owner. Part of that is because you have less income. That's why you're renting. But it is also because housing itself is contributing to this increasing division between rich and poor.\"\nAnd yet here we are again, on the verge of a new round of incentives that could offset some of that good work.\nThe Conservatives and the New Democratic Party both promised to increase the maximum amortization period for first-time homebuyers to 30 years from 25, which would lower monthly payments, but saddle borrowers with more debt.\nFinance Minister Bill Morneau used his pre-election budget to increase the amount that firsttime buyers can pull from their RRSPs for a down payment. He also introduced a shared-equity scheme that allows some firsttime buyers to work with CMHC as a co-investor, which at least allows individuals and families who insist on chasing runaway home prices to do so without exceeding reasonable debt loads.\nAt the start of the campaign, Trudeau said he would adjust the program so more people from the most expensive cities could qualify.\nSiddall is untroubled by the original co-investment plan. He said on \nTwitter\n this week that CMHC had committed about $40 million to 2,000 applicants so far. In the interview, Siddall said he reckons the program's inflationary effects will add only about $114 to the price of a home.\nHe characterized it as a reasonable political response to the minority of creditworthy borrowers blocked by the stress test.\nBut honestly, this stuff has to stop.\nThe real-estate industry is getting all the help it needs from the drop in mortgage rates that followed the \nU.S. Federal Reserve\n's decision to cut its benchmark rate this year. Yet it still advocates for \"tweaks\" to the measures the federal government put in place to stop the credit binge, and too many politicians continue to treat the housing lobby as if its members are the buyers, not the builders and brokers who are enriched by bubbly markets.\nSiddall offered a preview of some CMHC research on what would happen if Parliament enacted all of the proposals from the campaign. The calculation includes an enhanced shared-equity program; an easier stress test that reduces the interest rate that borrowers must show they could afford by a percentage point; and the longer amortization period. Assuming a response rate of 100 per cent, average prices would rise by as much as $16,000, said Siddall.\nIn Toronto, the increase would be $40,000, and in Vancouver $80,000.\n\"These aren't tweaks,\" Siddall said. \"These are real numbers.\""},

You can get a mortgage now for around 2.5 per cent for five years where a year ago you would be paying somewhere above three per cent.\"\nHe said the average value of a home in B.C. dropped 2.4 per cent in 2019 to $522,000, but that same home value is expected to increase 3.8 per cent next year and by another four per cent in 2021.\nYu said the median home price in Vancouver dropped about 10 per cent from last year and is currently at about $690,000. In Victoria, the median home price is $600,000.\nHe said the rental vacancy rate in most B.C. urban centres remains tight at slightly more than one per cent, while rents are expected to increase by 4.5 per cent for tenants looking for new homes.\nThe B.C. government's most recent financial quarterly report released in September said home sales decreased by more than 16 per cent from January to July 2019 compared with the same period in 2018. The government's report said Metro home sales from January to July 2019 fell 21.5 per cent compared with the first seven months of 2018.\nYu said the coming months will see the resale market rebuild, but double-digit price increases aren't expected. \"As we see the migration flows coming in, the population growth numbers and the tight labour market, those (factors) should be enough to provide some stimulus,\" he said. \"It's not going to be heading to the level you saw pre-stress test, but prices are on the rise again in our view.\""},

A study of west downtown finds that most don't", "date": "25 November 2019", "Journal": "Toronto Star", "author": "Donovan Vincent", "wordscount": "962", "content": "Driving around Toronto you'll often see signs with realtors advertising how they've successfully sold a property for \u201cover asking.\u201d\nThe impression one could take from this is the city's housing market is a seller's paradise with long lines of potential homebuyers willing to outbid each other, driving prices up and sending sellers running gleefully to the bank.\nBut some new research suggests this perception may not match reality.\nCurious to test out the notion that \u201cover asking\u201d sales are the norm or close to that and to learn why houses sell for over or under asking, Igor Dragovic, an urban land economist and licensed realtor, recently analyzed 4,230 home sales for January to November this year in a specific downtown Toronto area.\nHe found that only 29 per cent of homes sold over asking.\nThe vast majority of homes in west downtown \u2014 the area bounded by Bloor Street to the north, the waterfront to the south, Yonge Street to the east and the rail lines near Lansdowne Avenue to the west \u2014 sold at or under their listed price, Dragovic discovered.\n\u201cI was a lit bit surprised to see this in downtown west, generally a pretty hot pocket in housing right now,\u201d Dragovic said in an interview.\nHe used data collected by the \nToronto Real Estate Board\n, and compared specific neighbourhoods in the area.\nThe analysis also took in various housing types including semis, detached homes, condos and townhouses.\nDragovic found that the Bay Street corridor had the lowest percentage of homes selling over asking \u2014 84 of the 610 units sold or 14 per cent, while neighbourhoods such as Dufferin Grove and Trinity Bellwoods, where more lowrise houses exist, are seeing about 50 per cent of homes selling for over asking. In Trinity Bellwoods for example, 76 homes sold at or under the listed price while 75 sold over.\nIn terms of housing types, semis, Dragovic found, ranked the highest in terms of homes selling over asking \u2014 106 of 173 units (61 per cent).\nDragovic says he was \u201csurprised\u201d by the low rate of condos that sold for over asking \u2014 90 of 208 condo townhouses (43 per cent) sold over asking, while 934 of 3,541 condo apartments (26 per cent) sold above asking.\nHe also took another approach to his analysis \u2014 looking at differences in listing and selling prices per square foot for homes in the downtown west block.\nFor his research, a total of 3,989 of the 4,230 of the home sales Dragovic analyzed included data on the square footage of the unit.\nComparing, for example, Trinity Bellwoods and the Bay Street corridor, Dragovic found that homes in the latter are a bit pricier per square foot. Semis, which are common in Trinity Bellwoods, generally have lower values when it comes to dollars per square foot, Dragovic notes \u2014 an average $840 per square foot in Trinity Bellwoods compared to $1,046 per square foot in the Bay Street area.\nBut he argues that launching a bidding war \u2014 pricing a property low to stimulate several increasingly higher offers from buyers \u2014 seems to work in an area like Trinity Bellwoods. There, homes sold over the listing price went for an average $871 per square foot, while those sold at or under the listing price sold for an average $811 per square foot.\nThe premium between the listed and sold price for homes that went over asking is 18 per cent in Trinity Bellwoods \u2014 $740 per square foot listed compared to $871 per square foot sold.\nBy contrast, Dragovic notes, bidding wars don't seem to be a good strategy in the Bay Street corridor. Homes there sold over listing price go for about $989 per square foot.\nMeanwhile, homes sold at or under listing in the corridor sell at $1,053 per square foot.\nThe premium between the listed and selling price for units sold over asking in the corridor is nine per cent \u2014 $900 per square foot listed compared to the $989 per square foot sale price.\nJohn Pasalis, president of Realosophy, a Toronto real estate brokerage that analyzes data to provide advice to residential real estate investors, buyers and sellers, says starting a bidding war by intentionally pricing one's home low is akin to rolling the dice.\n\u201cWhen you list your home for sale in a particular area, part of how many offers you get is how nice your house is compared to the other houses that got listed that week, how many other houses got listed that week, what are they asking, and what nights are they taking their offers on,\u201d Pasalis says.\nPasalis' most recent listing \u2014 in Leslieville \u2014 went for what the vendor wanted: $1.2 million.\n\u201cWe weren't confident because the market is less predictable now. We listed for $1.2 million and sold for $1.2 million \u2014 it's a time-of-year thing,\u201d Pasalis explained.\nGenerally, a house or condo will go for what was established by recent sales, says Toronto \nRoyal LePage\n realtor Desmond Brown.\n\u201cEvery now and then, a new precedent will be set when someone pays a higher price,\u201d Brown added.\n\u201cI always say there are two ways to a sale price; underprice and get a bidding war or price a bit over or around market value and negotiate a deal between one buyer and seller.\u201d\nDonovan Vincent is a housing reporter based in Toronto.

That's why, if you're shopping for your first home, it's important to ensure that you've done your research and are working with the right professionals.\nWhile it may seem like a daunting process, there are a handful of ways in which homebuyers can prepare themselves for what will likely be the biggest transaction of their lives thus far.\n\"Working with first-time buyers is actually lots of fun because to them everything is fresh and new,\" said Jay Deakin, real estate broker and owner of Deakin Reality. \"That said, the stress level can be higher than with experienced buyers due to the scale of the purchase. People tend to be quite anxious about their first home and it's understandable; buying a property is a huge deal and not something we do every day.\"\nMany first-time buyers are surprised by how much work and time goes into shopping for a home. While properties in Montreal are selling at a record pace after being listed, that doesn't automatically translate into a quick experience for buyers. In fact, it can take months of shopping to find the right property for sale.\n\"Buyers often begin the shopping process thinking they know exactly what they want in a property, but after visiting properties and having the benefit of comparing them, their priorities change,\" said Daniela Lamorte, real estate broker with M Immobilier. \"Starting the process early enough allows them to see more houses, decipher what they need versus what they want, and know what their deal breakers are. It puts them in a better position to act quickly when the right one comes along.\"\nOnce buyers find a home they want and make an offer that's accepted by the seller, it can still be weeks and even months before the notary process unrolls and occupancy take place.\n\"So people really need to be careful and give themselves enough time,\" Lamorte said. \"We're November now and I've already been out looking with my first-time buyers with leases ending next June.\"\nWhile the learning curve can be daunting, starting early can help alleviate any pressure associated with having to act quickly, especially if you need occupancy in a new residence by a specific date.\n\"Buyers need to be ready to embrace the process and spend a good portion of their free time on house hunting,\" Deakin said. \"And, as brokers, we have to understand and respect the buyer's experience level when we start; our services need to be customized to make sure each client is comfortable throughout the process.\"\nWhen it comes to seeking counsel, first-time buyers would be well advised to speak to friends and family who have been through the buying process before, but to keep in mind that others'opinions don't need to dictate their own.\n\"Relatives, especially parents, are often involved and can be helpful at guiding buyers through the process,\" Deakin said. \"But in some cases family members can add to the stress, especially if they haven't been in the property market for some time and are out of touch with the process and local market prices.\"\nThis happens often with firsttime buyers, Lamorte added.\n\"While their opinions and support can be helpful, and they're well-meaning, there's often a point at which family involvement can become a detriment to the process,\" she said. \"It's important for buyers to set boundaries and focus on their personal needs because it is their home, after all.\"\nIn addition to family and friends, seeking guidance from knowledgeable and reputable professionals is essential. These include mortgage brokers to determine budget and ideally obtain mortgage preapproval, and real estate brokers to help locate properties within the set budget.\n\"Do not try and do it alone,\" Deakin said. \"Speak to friends and family and get references for real estate brokers, bankers, building inspectors and notaries. People close to you who have recently been through the process can be a great resource as they have all the contacts.\"\nBuyers also shouldn't hesitate to be selective in whom they choose to work with.\n\"You want to find a good fit both personally and professionally,\" Deakin said. \"You want someone who is an expert in your desired area, but it's equally important to find someone you trust and will enjoy working with.\"\nThe trust factor is significant as well because buyers should feel comfortable communicating their needs with their broker and accepting the broker's advice, Lamorte added.\nFor buyers in the market for the first time, the Organisme d'autor\u00e9glementation du courtage immobilier du Qu\u00e9bec (OACIQ) is a great resource.\nThe organization is mandated by the Quebec government to provide support and information for buyers and sellers throughout every step of the real estate transaction process.

Dwindling supply remains an issue, as evidenced by monthly and quarterly figures. The metropolitan area includes the island of Montreal, Laval, the South Shore and northern suburbs as far away as Mirabel.\n\"It's fair to say the market is overheating,\" Charles Brant, director of market analysis at the association, said Thursday in a telephone interview. \"Prices are rising, and the pace of sales is quickening. It's unusual to see this vigour persist so late into the year.\"\nAppetite for real estate is being propped up by low interest rates and a vibrant Quebec economy, which supports wage increases and buying power. Positive immigration flows and a relative dearth of properties in central Montreal neighbourhoods such as Mile End, Rosemont and the Plateau are also playing a key role, Brant said.\n\"In a way, Montreal is a victim of its own success,\" he said. \"There is a scarcity effect at play. Yes, new housing is being built, but it's often for rental units. The supply deficit should likely persist for the next two years.\"\nOctober marked the 49th consecutive month in which the number of properties for sale declined, QPAREB data show. About 16,900 residential properties were listed on the Centris system in October, a 20-per-cent decrease from the same month a year ago. This is the largest drop for the month of October since 2002.\nThis persistent scarcity is one of the main reasons the association expects the market to remain strong into 2021.\n\"We're forecasting somewhat of a slowdown next year, but there will continue to be supply deficit,\" Brant said. \"Interest rates are going to remain low, which means 2020 should still be a good year for real estate in Montreal.\"\nInterest rates on five-year mortgages averaged 5.19 per cent in the third quarter, association data show. That's less than the 5.34-per-cent average recorded in the year-earlier quarter Single-family homes outshone other types of properties in October, posting an eight-per-cent median price increase to $355,000, the data show. Plexes - defined as properties with two to five dwellings - saw their median price climb seven per cent to $560,000, while condominium prices advanced six per cent to $280,000.\nAs always, the aggregate figures hide vast disparities between city sectors. The areas analyzed by the association often group together several city boroughs.\nFor the third quarter, single-family home prices rose the fastest in C\u00f4te des Neiges/C\u00f4te St-Luc, according to the association. The median home in the area sold for $776,168 in the period, a 22-per-cent jump from last year's third quarter.\nSud-Ouest, which includes Verdun, ranked second on the island of Montreal with a 20-per-cent increase, followed by Lachine/LaSalle at 14 per cent. Single-family homes in Sud-Ouest sold for $658,000, while the median price in Lachine/LaSalle was $500,000, the data show.\nBy contrast, median prices for single-family homes in Mercier/Hochelaga-Maisonneuve dropped by eight per cent last quarter to $383,500.\nSelling prices for individual neighbourhoods were only available on a quarterly basis and weren't disclosed for October. At least 30 transactions are required in a given month for the data to be considered statistically significant, Brant said.\nFor condominiums, Villeray registered the steepest quarterly increase in median prices with a 27-per-cent jump, to $334,000.\nMost types of properties are selling more quickly. Single-family homes that sold in October stayed on the market for an average of 59 days - 15 days fewer than in October 2018. Condominiums took an average of 69 days to sell, the shortest period of time since 2004. The average selling time for plexes was 74 days, four more than in October 2018.\nAll told, 4,211 residential sales were concluded in the greater Montreal area last month. That's 14 per cent more than in the same month a year ago. ftomesco@postmedia.com"},
{"title": "Portrait Of A First-Time Buyer Changed After Mortgage Tests; Haider-Moranis Bulletin", "date": "21 November 2019", "Journal": "Ottawa Citizen", "author": "", "wordscount": "1028", "content": "Statistics in poll indicate higher burdens related to affordability even as prices fell, Murtaza Haider and Stephen Moranis say.\nThe mortgage stress test, extended to uninsured mortgages in January 2018, has generated a diversity of opinions. Its proponents argue that the stress test has introduced financial discipline while not hurting prospective homebuyers. The discontents believe that the stress test has eroded the affordability of first-time homebuyers, some of whom have been forced to rent for more extended periods.\nThe recently released \nCanada Mortgage and Housing Corporation\n mortgage consumer survey helps unpack the arguments on the impact of the stress test. The CMHC surveyed 1,385 homebuyers across Canada who had undertaken a mortgage transaction in the past 18 months. This implies that some respondents reported on their mortgage-related experience from 2018.\nAn exciting feature of the survey is the distinction between first-time homebuyers, who constituted 47 per cent of the sample, and the repeat buyers representing the other 53 per cent.\nThe majority of the first-time homebuyers were 25 to 34 years old, compared to just 17 per cent of the repeat buyers. Also, singles accounted for almost one in four first-time homebuyers compared to one in 10 repeat buyers. Interestingly, 61 per cent of the respondents were female, suggesting an increase in home purchasing by women.\nThe homebuyers'top concerns in 2019 were housing affordability, housing size and proximity to public transit. These concerns coincided with housing prices declining across Canada in 2018 as prices remained lower than the peak prices reached in either 2016 or 2017.\nMany industry observers credited the stress test for the decline in prices and the erosion of housing affordability because homebuyers had to qualify at a mortgage rate approximately two percentage points higher than the contracted rate. The 2019 survey, though, presents a positive impression of the stress test among homebuyers.\nThe survey reported that 65 per cent of the buyers believed the stress test would \"keep more Canadians from taking on a mortgage they can't afford.\" However, one in five homebuyers acquired a dwelling that did not meet their needs.\nAn interesting picture emerges when one compares the share of first-time homebuyers respondents in 2018 and 2019. The 2018 survey, completed in April 2018, interviewed 4,000 respondents who had undertaken a mortgage transaction in the past 12 months. This implies that most respondents in the 2018 survey would have reported on their homebuying experience before the stress test's reach was broadened in January 2018.\nMost homebuyers (56 per cent) in the 2018 survey were first-time homebuyers, but their share fell to 47 per cent in the 2019 survey. Could it be that a decline of 16 per cent in the share of first-time homebuyers in the 2019 survey was partially due to the stress-test-induced erosion of housing affordability? Other statistics reported in the survey are indicative of the higher affordability burdens even when housing prices had declined from the peak observed earlier.\nConsider that 22 per cent of first-time homebuyers reported renting for more than 10 years in the 2018 survey. Their share jumped to 31 per cent in 2019. Hence, a much larger share of first-time homebuyers, who had purchased homes in 2018-19, reported renting for more than 10 years to save for a house.\nAnother indicator of a shift in the demographics is the share of first-time homebuyers who had rented with family and friends before buying. Interestingly, the family-and friends-assisted cohort of first-time homebuyers jumped from 28 per cent in 2018 to 44 per cent in 2019. Similarly, those first-time homebuyers who rented on their own before buying a house declined from 39 per cent in 2018 to 23 per cent in 2019.\nAt the same time, no fewer than 76 per cent of the respondents reported that the changes related to the stress test \"had little or no impact on their decision to buy a home.\" However, of the remaining 24 per cent (one in four homebuyers) affected by the stress test, some compromises were needed on the path to home ownership. Most cut back on other expenses (60 per cent), relied more on their savings (59 per cent) or bought a smaller home (52 per cent).\nWhereas 47 per cent of homebuyers affected by the stress test purchased a smaller or less expensive home in 2018, a much larger share of 61 per cent reported the same in 2019.\nThe increase in household debt burdens, primarily because of mortgage-related debt, is also reflected in the survey. Compared to 2018, when 19 per cent of buyers reported their debt being higher than expected, the share increased to 23 per cent in 2019. Of those struggling with making regular mortgage payments, 73 per cent cited the credit card debt as the reason.\nThe comparative stats further revealed that buyers with less than 20 per cent of the down payment increased in 2019 compared to 2018. Furthermore, the 2019 survey found a slight increase in the share of those \"who didn't have enough saved for a larger down payment.\"\nCMHC's 2019 survey of homebuying offers valuable insights on how homebuying has changed over the past few years. Though the survey periods do not permit a strict before-and-after comparison of homebuying concerning the stress test, still the indicators reported suggest that in 2019, first-time home buyers accounted for fewer homebuyers, comprised of a larger share of those who rented for more extended periods, and their savings increasingly fell short to qualify for a mortgage.

Moving westward, it could take as long as to 217 years to save up for a down payment based on the same median household income. Data on median household income were sourced from \nStatistics Canada\n.\n\u201cIn the three priciest luxury neighbourhoods including Richmond, Vancouver West and West Vancouver, where benchmark home prices range between $1.5 to $2.9 million, it would actually take more than 100 years to come up with the needed funds,\u201d wrote Penelope Graham, managing editor of Zoocasa and author of the report.\nWhile detached homes may be out of reach of median income earners, apartments in North Delta, Maple Ridge, and Port Coquitlam are the fastest route to home ownerships, where prices range from $372,000 to $437,000, according to the report.\nThe least affordable neighbourhoods for condo apartments are West Vancouver, Vancouver West and Burnaby, where prices range from $650,000 to $1.04 million.\nGraham says that the report isn't meant to paint a \u201crealistic scenario\u201d of how homebuyers are attaining homes, because they would alternatively seek out housing they can afford. But the numbers do reveal that incomes have not caught up with housing affordability in some Metro Vancouver municipalities.\nEven in municipalities such as Maple Ridge, North Delta and Pitt Meadows where there are relatively more affordable detached homes that fetch $800,000 to $900,000, the prices are \u201cfar beyond\u201d the reach of median income earners. Buyers would need to save between 27 to 32 years just for their down payment, according to Graham.\nDespite the gap between prices and median income, all residential properties dropped over the last year[https://www.thestar.com/vancouver/2019/11/05/home-prices-are-falling-in-vancouver-no-really-they-are.html].\nThe benchmark price for all property types is currently $992,900, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver. This is a 6.4 per cent decrease from last October, a 1.7 per cent decrease over the past six months, and a 0.2 per cent increase compared to September 2019.\nDetached houses are at a benchmark of $1,410,500, a decline of 7.5 per cent, while apartments cost $652,500, declining 5.9 per cent compared to last year.\nThis comes while home sales are experiencing a boost, according monthly reports released by the board.\n\u201cWith prices edging down over the last year and interest rates remaining low, hopeful home buyers are becoming more active this fall,\u201d Ashley Smith, president of the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver, said in a release.\nMetro Vancouver was hit hard by the affordability crisis, leading to provincial policies and even ending up on the federal stage during the election campaign.\nVancouver's previously red-hot real estate market sparked a public outcry and government action starting in 2016. The market has now slowed dramatically after a series of B.C. taxes aimed at foreign buyers and speculative activity, tougher bank lending rules brought in by the federal government, and tighter currency controls implemented by the Chinese government.\nThe calculations in the report are based on the maximum mortgage one qualifies for on a median income buying a home in 16 municipalities at the benchmark price. It also factored in the mortgage stress test rate of 5.19 per cent, a 25-year amortization, and carrying costs of one per cent in property taxes plus a monthly heating bill of $100.\nWith files from Melanie Green\nJenny Peng is a Vancouver-based reporter covering culture and business.

Let's start with Vancouver Most of the horror stories around money being lost in residential real estate are based on sales of highend detached homes in the province's most populous city.\nUsing detached homes as a bellwether, Landcor data shows that the value of a detached home in the city fell 11.3 per cent for the first nine months of this year compared to last, with the median price now being $1.825 million.\nThere were 1,172 detached homes sold from the start of January to the end of September this year, compared to 1,448 for the same period in 2018. The value of those sales fell from $3.8 billion to $2.76 billion. Almost 73 per cent of detached homes sold in Vancouver in the first nine months of 2019 went for below assessed value.\nCondo owners in Vancouver experienced a 3.3 per cent rise in the median price on 30 per cent fewer sales. 2. LNG boom in Kitimat leads to huge jump in home values There's an energy boom underway in northwest B.C., driven by a $40-billion LNG project in Kitimat.\nThere are already 1,000 workers setting up the construction site at the mouth of Douglas Channel, with 7,500 workers expected from 2022 to 2024. That creates a big need for housing and it shows in the data.\nIn Kitimat, the price of a detached home jumped almost 50 per cent in the first nine months of the year compared to the same period in 2018.\nWhile the number of detached home sales actually fell from 99 to 91, the value of those sales soared from $28.1 million to $38.7 million, and only two homes sold for less than assessed value.\nNearby Terrace had a 21 per cent increase in the value of a detached home to an average of $385,000. 3. How are things in Surrey? While owners of detached homes in Surrey fared better than in Vancouver, condo owners fared worse.\nThere were 2,201 detached homes sales in the first nine months of 2019, a 22 per cent drop from the same period of 2018.\nSales volumes were $2.7 billion for the same period compared to $3.6 billion.\nInterestingly, that shows that the total sales volumes in Surrey and Vancouver for detached homes are about the same.\nThe median price of a detached home fell three per cent to $1.038 million, while the median price of a condo was down 9.3 per cent to $365,700.\nJust over 50 per cent of detached homes sold in Surrey for the first nine months of 2019 went for below the assessed value.\n4. The beautiful Kootenays are doing OK A common refrain in Vancouver is \"I'd love to live in Nelson.\"\nIt's the Jewel of the Kootenays, rural with city touches, a worldclass ski hill nearby and a reputation for cool known around the world.\nThe Landcor data shows several Kootenay towns doing well on the real estate front.\nIn Nelson, the median price of a detached home rose 11.4 per cent to $440,000, and despite the average assessed value of a detached home rising 16 per cent from 2018 to June 30, 2019, more than 65 per cent of the homes sold in the first nine months of 2019 went for over assessed.\nSalmo and Slocan saw a 27 per cent jump in detached home values, while Creston went up 10 per cent and Castlegar 11 per cent. 5. Victoria not so hot, but Langford is Victoria has seen detached home values fall, though not as much as Vancouver. A detached home is now worth $790,000 on average, which is 4.8 per cent less than in 2018. Volumes are down slightly, with 171 sales in the first nine months of this year; almost 80 per cent of those sales were below the assessed value.\nBut west of Victoria, in Langford, detached home values soared 12 per cent in the same period, while detached homes in the Gulf Islands rose 19 per cent in average value. dcarrigg@postmedia.com twitter.com/davidcarrigg"},

It's not even built yet, but news of construction has led to price increases of $40,000 - or eight per cent.\nIn St. Catharines and Niagara Falls, around planned GO stations in those communities, there has also been a price jump of $30,000 - eight per cent and seven per cent, respectively.\n\"These GO stations have a material impact on prices,\" said Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation senior analyst Anthony Passarelli. \"It's an extra amenity that will add value.\"\nAlso interesting with the West Harbour station, is that most of the price rise occurred between the time of the project's announcement in 2013 and its completion in 2015, which suggests homebuyers got excited about talk of the opening, but may have become less enthusiastic after the ribbon was cut.\nThe station currently is a long way from full-day service, with four commuter departures in the morning and four returning trains in the late afternoon.\n\"When the station was opened, there were expectations of full-day service very quickly and it didn't happen. That might be part of the reason why most of the price increase happened between the announcement and the station completion date,\" said Passarelli.\nThe West Harbour GO station part of his study - looking at average prices in the Hamilton Centre neighbourhood bounded by Kenilworth and James, the Mountain and the bay - found increases of $215,000 since 2013, with $30,000 of that increase attributed to the station.\nTo come to that conclusion, CMHC researchers compared the Hamilton findings to a section of Brantford that was experiencing price increases at the same rate as Hamilton Centre. From that, they were able to tease out the effect of the station introduction in Hamilton.\n\"Prices have been growing at a high rate in places that didn't have a station as well, just not as much as in Hamilton Centre,\" he said.\nThe same methodology of using a control group was also used to analyze the GO station effect in Stoney Creek, St. Catharines and Niagara Falls.\nIncreased demand for housing is just one economic outcome from GO stations, said Judy Lam, with the city's economic development division.\n\"The West Harbour station in particular is key to the future growth of Hamilton. We're trying to attract people that will serve as the future workforce for the companies that we are attracting here,\" she said.\n\"Transit is one of the main attractions for young professionals who want to be in urban environments.\"\nHaving a viable public transportation link to Toronto, she said, will mean businesses can set up in Hamilton with an easier connection to Toronto for meetings and networking. And that becomes an incentive for businesses to open here.\nA key to this is for GO stations to move to toward full-day service, something that could be years away, she said.\nWhen that happens, Passarelli said, it will likely affect prices again.\n\"If it does or when it does, you will probably see further increases as a result,\" he said.\nmmcneil@thespec.com\n905-526-4687 | @Markatthespec"},

For new parents Katti-Lynn Derouchie and her fiance, Matthew Nykolichuk, scraping together many thousands of dollars just wasn't going to happen.\nNykolichuk is between jobs in the oil and gas sector and Derouchie, who works at the Peter Lougheed Hospital, has money tied up in small condo in northeast Calgary. When they decided to move closer to family in Chestermere, they were resigned to being renters until they stumbled upon Skylar Townhomes in the new subdivision of Kinniburgh.\n\"I had looked at Skylar way back when but didn't know there were townhomes there,\" says Derouchie.\n\"Terrence (the sales manager) emailed me about their rent-toown program to help people save for their down payment by leasing for a year. It pretty much checked off all the boxes to help us be homeowners.\"\n\nCalvin Buss, president of Buss Marketing, worked with Vancouver-based Alture Properties in the creation of the rent-to-own program. Alture is building the 70-unit townhome project that includes 16 duplexes which were originally constructed by failed Alberta builder, \nReid Built Homes\n.\n\"A lot of people can handle the monthly payments but don't have the down payment. With interest rates in the two and three per cent area, mortgage payments are close to rental costs,\" he says.\nIf a buyer chooses the rent-toown option, they're treated just like a regular new home buyer. They can choose their unit, their interiors and even upgrade their appliances. A $5,000 deposit holds the unit as it's being built, then another $980 deposit is required prior to move-in and then the buyer makes monthly payments for the next 12 months which are credited back toward the down payment.\nDerouchie says when they take possession next summer, their payments on a three-bedroom townhome will be $1,850 a month.\n\"Small, two-bedrooms here in Chestermere are renting for $1,800 a month, so to have three bedrooms for $1,850 is awesome,\" she says.\nSkylar has three townhome floor plans from 1,488 square feet to 1,760 square feet starting at $334,800. Derouchie and Nykolichuk chose the three-bedroom \"A\" model, a corner unit, because they want room for another child in the future.\nThe home has a ground level double-car garage with a flex room that Derouchie says will be a \"man cave.\"\n\"He gets that and I get everything else,\" she says, laughing.\nThe second level has an open concept living area with a half bathroom and a deck off the dining area. Upstairs are three bedrooms, two full bathrooms and a compact laundry area.\nLocated on the south side of Chestermere, with a new school and easy access to the lake, Skylar is in a developing family neighbourhood. Derouchie grew up in Chestermere and says that, even though it's grown a lot in the past few years, it still has a small-town feel.\n\"It's not noisy. It's clean and well maintained. The City of Chestermere does a really good job of keeping it tidy,\" she says.\nBuss says the rent-to-own program was launched just a few months ago and about 10 individuals have taken advantage of it.\n\"You can rent for a year and if you decide after that you want to buy it, we'll credit all the rent towards your down payment. If you don't want to buy, your rent's gone. But people say, 'Are you serious? It's like living there for free for a whole year.'And we say, 'Yeah!'It helps them and it helps us,\" he says.\nDerouchie is grateful for the opportunity.\n\"I think it's awesome that builders are working with families to attain a home, because nowadays, to save up that down payment, well, there's always one thing after another.

More than one third of respondents were from Ontario, while a quarter were from Quebec.\nThat the number of first-time home buyers has decreased didn't come as much of a surprise for Colette Kikongi, CMHC's planning specialist and spokesperson. A number of factors, including housing affordability, played a role in making the number of qualified buyers go down, she said.\n\"Eighty per cent of the buyers said that being able to find a house that they could afford was a necessity for them,\" said Kikongi, who noted home prices have been steadily climbing in markets such as Toronto and Vancouver over the past few years, making it harder for new buyers to break in.\n\"Affordability is the main concern. Also, we see in our data that half of the home buyers are concerned about housing costs and home expenditure being too much. All that combined would probably explain why there is a decrease,\" she added.\nHome prices in the Toronto region are projected to climb even higher, with an average of $949,400 by 2021, according to another CMHC report released last month.\nStill, results from the consumer survey showed most first-time home buyers live in Ontario, and are between the ages of 18 and 34. The survey also showed that newcomers to the market are taking their time before committing to home ownership, partly because of affordability, but also, partly, because they are being more careful about the commitment.\nThe number of first-time home buyers who were renting for more than 10 years before buying jumped from 22 per cent in 2018 to 31 per cent in 2019, according to the report."},

{"title": "Sweetly Real Estate Has A Fresh,Hasslefree Approach To Selling Your Home; Real Estate; Sponsored By Sweetly Real Estate", "date": "15 November 2019", "Journal": "Edmonton Journal", "author": "Cindy Stephen", "wordscount": "947", "content": "Buying a new home is exciting.\nSelling an existing home... not so much.\nBetween keeping it clean, vacating for showings and sweating over a lack of offers - especially if there's a deadline - selling is far too stressful.\nSweetly has a fresh, hassle-free approach to traditional selling. An alternative to being 'for sale,'Sweetly offers to buy your home, resell it and pay homeowners all their equity less their service fee. Launched this fall by wellrespected Edmonton Realtor, Ed DePrato with a vision to simplify the home selling process, Sweetly eliminates a lengthy, and often invasive sales process by enabling homeowners to sell without the traditional hassles of showings, open houses and for-sale signs.\nIt starts with a professional evaluation, online or in-person.\n\"We'll show the seller what similar homes are listed for so they understand their home's current value. Then we give them a choice. They can list it with us traditionally, where we charge a normal real estate commission of about 4 per cent if the property sells, or, we will buy it and resell it after you've moved out,\" says DePrato.\nThe Sweetly offer is very straightforward. The home is purchased at approximately 80 per cent of the evaluation. The remaining 20 per cent is paid to the seller minus Sweetly's service fee of 5.5 per cent when the property is resold.\n\"If we say the home is worth $500,000, we buy it for $400,000 and leave $100,000 in the deal. This is not our money, it's the seller's money. We leave it there so we have something to charge our fee against,\" he explains.\nThe seller receives the second payment of $72,500 once the home is resold.\nDePrato says there are four distinct advantages to selling Sweetly. The perfect possession date No panic to pack, no stress about moving. The seller can take Sweetly's offer and move out whenever they want. If the possession date on a new home is a moving target, which frequently happens with new construction, a firm sale to Sweetly provides the luxury of a fluid moving date.\n\"If your builder has to push back the possession date on your new home, we can change yours too with no fees,\" says DePrato.\nHe also says that in traditional transactions, possession dates can be used as leverage during negotiations, which isn't an issue with Sweetly.\n\"In a traditional scenario, a seller might be tempted to lower the asking price to accommodate a potential buyer. That means they'll lose money, but we remove that concern from the entire equation,\" he says. Extreme certainty Like the chicken and the egg, which should come first; buying another home before yours is sold or selling your current home before you commit to another.\nDePrato calls it a 'Real estate catch 22'.\n\"If you buy first, you could potentially own two homes and become hyper motivated to sell, dropping your price until you're basically giving it away. But if you sell first, you have uncertainty.\nYour perfect home may not be available at the precise moment you enter the market so you'll either settle for something you don't really love or be forced to move twice,\" he says.\nOne advantage of using Sweetly? Sellers can unload their home in its current condition - 'as is'- barring major structural defects and foundation issues. Sell as is Sellers can unload their home in its current condition, barring major structural defects and foundation issues. Sweetly will identify any deficiencies and bring them to the attention of the seller who can either take care of it or turn it over to Sweetly who does the work and adds the cost to their fee.\nSale price guarantee When a home in a traditional real estate transaction doesn't sell, the price is lowered at the seller's loss. With Sweetly's price guarantee, if the home sells for less, they'll eat the difference.\n\"We charge six per cent for the guarantee. We offer a 95 per cent sale price guarantee on the evaluation we provide. If we told you your house is worth $500,000, we can guarantee it will sell for no less than $475,000, and our fee of six per cent will come off that. The net to the seller would be a minimum $446,500.

Non Profit Housing Association, said short-term rentals are just one part of an affordability crisis that escalated after decades of underfunding of housing initiatives.\n\"We know that (short-term rentals) contributes to affordability problems,\" he said. \"I'd say that there is a lot of focus on \nAirbnb\n, but it is not the silver bullet causing the affordability crisis. It is a contributing factor. It's not the sole problem that we have.\"\nClifford said the society, which represents the non-profit housing sector with more than 600 members, has data highlighting the extent of the affordability crisis across B.C.\nIn B.C., 43 per cent of renter homes spend more than the recommended affordability benchmark of 30 per cent of gross income on housing and utilities, he said. The national average is 40 per cent.\nClifford said 21 per cent of B.C. renters spend more than half of their income on rent and utilities, while the Canadian average is 18 per cent.\n\"One in five renters are in a crisis level of spending too much on rent,\" he said. \"It places households at risk of homelessness. If you are spending half of your income, what are you sacrificing?\" Clifford said he doesn't yet have evidence that the B.C. government's housing initiatives have had an impact on people needing housing.\n\"I want to say it's getting better,\" he said.\n\"We don't really know as of right now whether it is. All indications show rents are increasing. They are increasing faster than what average people are earning.\"\nHousing Minister Selina Robinson said B.C. is building its way out of a housing crisis that grew over several decades. She said thousands of affordable housing projects are under construction and people will start seeing new units by next year.\n\"We've been missing purpose-built rentals for decades,\" said Robinson. \"We had an out-ofcontrol housing market. We really had not enough subsidized housing being built in the last couple of decades.\"\nLast year, The NDP government introduced an almost $7-billion affordable housing plan to deliver 114,000 units in a decade.\nRobinson said construction of 22,459 units is underway. Of those units, she said 3,281 homes are complete, 6,304 are under construction and 12,874 are in the development and approval process.\n\"There are people on construction sites, But remember, typically, you have 18 to 48 months depending on where and which community.\nThat's how long it takes.\"\nWachsmuth said B.C.'s housing plan is leading Canada when it comes to facing the challenges of housing supply and affordability, but more needs to be done.\n\"Ultimately, the solution has to be governments at the provincial and federal level making much more significant investments in public housing, in subsidized housing and in market housing as well,\" he said.

Ndp Facing Tough Questions About Deficit", "date": "12 November 2019", "Journal": "Vancouver Sun", "author": "Rob Shaw", "wordscount": "1098", "content": "Finance Minister Carole James is scrambling behind the scenes to keep B.C.'s budget from slipping into the red.\nBut some New Democrat supporters must be wondering if it's even worth the hassle in light of the recent federal election.\nVoters there issued a collective shrug to the idea of years of government deficits, as long as the money would ease the cost pressures they are facing on all sides, from housing affordability to child care and health care.\nParties that had no plans to curtail deficit spending captured more than 55 per cent of the popular vote collectively. And only three per cent of uncommitted voters in an Angus Reid poll before voting day last month said debt and deficits were a top issue.\nBut back in B.C., James and the New Democrat government are still scrounging for every penny to keep their budget in the black.\nThe province's second quarter financial results, to be released later this month, are expected to show James'razor-thin $179-million surplus forecast under siege by a softening economy, slowing housing market, collapsing forestry sector and the roaring financial dumpster fire that is the \nInsurance Corp\n of B.C.\nIt may still be possible to keep the books balanced this year by blowing out contingency funds and cutting discretionary spending.\nBut what about next year's budget, set to be tabled in February? James is scraping that together right now as well. You can imagine what kind of miserly money management will be required to eke out a small surplus in the current circumstances, not to mention with the looming threat of a $1-billion court challenge to ICBC caps on minor injury claims. It's going to be ugly.\nNDP supporters hoping to see accelerated $10-a-day child care, more money for unionized workers, and big boosts to core services like education, health care, welfare, disability and shelter rates can kiss those dreams goodbye. All of which presents a dilemma for the government.\nDoes it want to spend the final two years of its mandate talking about prudence, caution, AAA credit ratings and all the other budgetary catchphrases famously uttered by the previous Liberal government as it wrestled away bus passes from the disabled and maternity benefits from low-income mothers in the name of modest surpluses? Or does it embrace a deficit? On its surface, that's dangerous territory for New Democrats who have spent 16 years being painted by the B.C. Liberals as reckless financial managers for deficit budgets in the 1990s.\nBut again, look to last month's federal campaign. Polls pointed to voter priorities of affordability, cost of living, climate change and health care, coincidentally many of the central planks of the B.C. NDP's 2017 election promises that won over urban voters in Metro Vancouver.\nPerhaps there is a third option for the B.C. NDP government.\nIt doesn't just slide into a small deficit while kicking, screaming and cutting the same services it promised the last election to increase. It uses the deficit as an opportunity to unshackle itself and make strategic investments in affordability programs with tangible benefits for cashstrapped British Columbians.\nOne option could be to immediately implement the $10-a-day child-care plan that was a centrepiece of the last election but is set to be phased in over a decade.\nThat could cost as much as $1.5 billion. Would thousands of parents care about a $1.5-billion provincial government deficit if they stood to save hundreds of dollars a month in child-care fees? The same could be asked about a radical housing affordability plan, or a resurrected renter's rebate, aggressive electric vehicle subsidies, major boosts to transit, or funding for new family doctors. Besides, the NDP knows that no matter what it does, it's going to be attacked by the Liberals for \"killing the economy,\" as Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson recently tweeted.\nAt least by picking an issue to hang the deficit on, the NDP would be daring the Liberals to campaign against it in the next election, whether that be scrapping the $10-a-day child-care program or something else.\nIf Premier John Horgan is actually considering bold deficit spending, he's not letting on.\n\"We have a downturn in the economy that is affecting the global economy, not just B.C.,\" Horgan said when asked earlier this month. \"But I have read two banking reports this week that continue to show B.C. leading the country in economic growth. We are going to continue to do our best to protect services, first and foremost, and ensure that we can continue to keep our books balanced.\"\nEconomists are split on the idea.\n\"Even if you get up to a deficit of a couple of billion dollars, in the context of the B.C. economy, you're looking at less than two-thirds of one per cent of GDP, and that's still a relatively modest deficit that is not something to worry about,\" said Alex Hemingway, an economist at the left-leaning \nCanadian Centre for Policy Alternatives\n.\nJock Finlayson, executive vice-president at the right-leaning B.C. Business Council, said the NDP's budgets are already \"poised on a knife's edge\" and the real solution is to craft an economic development plan.\n\"If you have a severe economic downtown, then running a budget deficit is much more defensible,\" he said. \"We're not in that position. We have an economy still growing. It's not growing as fast as it was two or three years ago, but it's still growing above the Canadian average.\"\nDifficult choices for an NDP government staring at the back half of its mandate. But choices that may ultimately determine if voters give the party a second term in control of the provincial purse strings. rshaw@postmedia.com twitter.com/robshaw_vansun"},

(It already included other communities outside Winnipeg, including Steinbach, Stonewall, Selkirk, Beausejour and Saint Adolphe, Squire said.)\nBut the year-over-year trends for October would have held even if those new areas weren't included, Squire said.\nHe thinks generational change is one possible reason for the buildup in listings.\n\u201cI think one of the things that I've seen, from talking to some of our members, is that I think you're starting to see that baby-boomer group... shed their bigger homes and look at alternatives, whether they're going to rent, because there is more multi-family available than we've ever seen.\"\nHomes in Winnipeg and outlying communities remain comparatively affordable on a national basis, Squire said, making them particularly attractive to first-time buyers \u2014 especially in combination with current low mortgage rates.\n\u201cIn a way, it's a bit of a win-win,\" he said. \u201cWe've got a lot of supply and choice for buyers, and they're obviously noticing that when they go on our MLS system and see what's available, but they're also still seeing an active buyer community, because we're generating some record levels.\"\nIn October, 1,173 homes changed hands in Winnipeg Realtors' metro Winnipeg area. Year-to-date, 12,086 sales were tracked through MLS, bringing area home sales close to an annual record.\nThe majority of detached homes and condos sold in October fetched a figure at or below list price. The average sales price for detached homes was $315,889, down 2.7 per cent from October 2018, and the average sales price for condos declined 2.8 per cent annually to $227,878.\n\u201cWe're a very stable housing market, we're probably as stable as any housing market in the entire country,\" Squire said. \u201cSo when I see a small dip in one month, that doesn't concern me.\"\nFrom Jan. 1 through Oct. 31 of this year, the average detached-home price for the Winnipeg metro area was $324,312, compared with $323,001 for the same period in 2018.\nThe most expensive detached home sold through MLS in the region during October went for $1,250,000, and the priciest condo was $612,037.\nKnow of any newsworthy developments in the local office, retail, industrial or multi-family-residential sectors?

After the city was destroyed by the NDP \"socialists\" for years, \nFord\n crowed, companies are now \"flowing into Hamilton.\"\nThere's Corbec, a Quebec-based steel company that's going to locate a new plant - worth between $50 million and $100 million - in the Red Hill Business Park. A $100-million DHL airport cargo expansion. Panattoni's new $30-million warehouse next to the airport. A $40-million expansion of the Mondelez candy factory. The possible $700-million renovation of the Hamilton City Centre.\nMeanwhile, it took just eight months this year for the city to reach $1 billion in building permit value, the earliest Hamilton has ever cracked that barrier. It marks the ninth time in 10 years the city has hit the billion-dollar mark.\nYet over at city hall, there's a much more ominous story developing that seems at odds with the rosy economic activity picture being painted.\nFinance staff and councillors are wrestling with a sobering proposed 2020 budget that's going to inflict pain on Hamilton residents one way or another.\nAs it stands, the property tax hike sits at 5.5 per cent, or an extra $196 per average property. To just get that down to a 2.6 per cent increase will require nearly $26 million in cuts.\nWhat gives? How can the city have such a robust economic development forecast coupled with such a devastating budget on the horizon?\nThere are a number of pressures on Hamilton, said Mike Zegarac, the city's general manager of finance, ranging from the total amount of assessed value of properties in the city, to the assessment mix, to the decisions of the very same provincial government that trumpeted Hamilton's successes in the legislature.\nReason 1: Not all building permit activity grows the tax base.\nTake the value of building permits, which reached $1.15 billion by the end of September.\nBuilding permits are based on the value of construction but not all construction leads to an increase in taxable assessment.\nFor instance, construction on institutional buildings - schools, universities, colleges, hospitals, government buildings, for example - doesn't lead to increased assessment because those properties aren't taxed. Or the construction could be maintenance-related, such as a commercial property replacing its HVAC system, which wouldn't change the building's assessed value.\n\"Someone should not necessarily be looking at the building permits and assuming that will translate directly into assessed value,\" said Zegarac.\nThe city has also been hurt by successful appeals that have reduced assessments in the big-box retail sector, as well as large industrial properties. Stelco's annual property taxes, for example, have dropped from $25 million a quarter century ago to less than $4 million in 2018.\nGrowing the amount of assessment is key because the higher the city's total assessment base, the lower the tax rate.\nBut it's worth pointing out there has been lots of construction activity in Hamilton over the past three years that has increased assessment.\nBetween the start of 2017 and September 2019, building permits have been issued for more than 3,600 houses, row houses and apartments.\nReason 2: Growth does not pay for growth.\nWhich leads to the second pressure, Zegarac said.\n\"Growth does not pay for growth in Hamilton, nor in fact across any municipality in Ontario,\" said Zegarac.\nIn other words, each new house built in Hamilton costs the city more than it recovers in development charges.\n\"The provincial government requires municipalities to subsidize growth through discounting some development charges,\" said Zegarac.\nThe province has recognized this deficit needs to be addressed, he added. Municipalities are now supposed to accommodate at least half of all new growth within existing urban boundaries.\n\"Financially, it's a more sustainable model as well as the environmental benefits of intensification versus urban sprawl,\" Zegarac said.\nHamilton also subsidizes growth by exempting development charges in specially designated areas of the city, such as the downtown.\n\"By offering up these subsidies, you have to recoup that foregone revenue from existing taxpayers,\" Zegarac said.\nReason 3: Uneven tax burden.\nThe third pressure is the way Hamilton's tax pie is divided.\nIn 2010, nearly 88 per cent of the city's tax assessment base came from residential and multi-residential properties. About 10 per cent was from commercial properties.\nJust two per cent was industrial property assessment, which was well below the provincial average of 2.8 per cent. In a 2009, tax study of 81 Ontario cities and towns, 48 of them had a higher proportion of assessment from industry than Hamilton, Canada's famed steelmaker.\nBurlington, perceived to be a bedroom commuter community, had a proportion of industrial tax assessment twice as large as Hamilton.\nNine years later, Hamilton's assessment mix has remained essentially unchanged, with 87 per cent coming from the residential and multi-residential sector and 13 per cent from the commercial and industrial sectors.\n\"It has been a strategic priority as a corporation to move that ratio by growing our non-residential assessment,\" said Zegarac. \"But we aren't able to move that yardstick.\"\nAnd it's not likely to move any time soon. In recent years, the average increases in assessment for the residential sector have outpaced increases in the non-residential sector because of the hot housing market. So the needle is moving the wrong way.\nHere's why this matters:\nWhy is this a concern? Three reasons.\nOne, more of the tax burden falls on the backs of residential property owners in Hamilton, so when there's a looming budget crunch, like the one now facing the city, the pain hits homeowners disproportionately.\nTwo, Hamilton has higher rates of poverty and lower household incomes than neighbouring communities, so residential property taxes take a bigger bite out of people's incomes.\nUsing 2016 median household income values from \nStatistics Canada\n, property taxes represented six per cent of median income for the average Hamilton residence compared to four per cent of median income in Burlington.\nThree, because of gentrification in recent years, the inner city neighbourhoods of Wards 1, 2 and 3 have seen the biggest jumps in property values so they will see the biggest jumps in property taxes compared to other parts of the city. Despite gentrification, these are the parts of the city that are home to the highest rates of poverty and low incomes.\nThe final pressure is the downloading of some provincial responsibilities back to Hamilton after the previous government had taken a net total of $45 million off Hamilton's shoulders over the past decade.\n\"The previous 10 years, we had relief,\" said Zegarac. \"This year, it's the reverse.\n\"We're looking at a very different relationship with the provincial government than the past decade.\"\nsbuist@thespec.com\n905-526-3226"},

People across Alberta can sell with Bode, while right now only people in Calgary and Edmonton can buy with Bode.\n\"We believe there is a substantial part of the market that will be excited about this,\" Price said. \"We understand that there will be people who don't have that confidence in the technology or haven't bought or sold a home before - this is about demystifying the experience. The industry has made it more complicated than it actually is.\"\nWhat makes Bode different, even though it is a licensed real-estate brokerage, said Price, is that it is the first peer to peer real-estate platform - the buyer and seller deal directly without a middle person. There's also a one per cent fee payable only once the property sells; there are no real-estate agent commissions.\nWhen you list a property, Bode, populates it online on its own site and others such as Realtor.ca, Zillow, Facebook Marketplace and Kijiji. The site also has built-in chat functionalities allowing buyers and sellers to interact; buyers also go through a verification process.\nAnother differentiator, added Price, is that you can make and accept an offer online. You will still, however, need your own lawyer.\nMeanwhile, forget about the printed listing sheet that realtors give out. Bode doesn't do that, it's all digital. And passed by an interesting for sale sign but not had a pen and paper on hand to take down the real estate agent's name and number? No worries. Bode is rolling out for sale signs that use QR codes. Use its app and your smartphone and you'll be set.\n\"There is a lot of supply in the Alberta market right now and people are motivated to keep as much of their home value as possible,\" Price said.\n\"So, the timing is ideal because the cost savings are dramatic, and the result is that homes sell faster, buyers pay less and sellers make more.\"\nBode also plans to roll out a digital marketplace featuring peer-reviewed home and professional services called the Bodiverse to support customers with expert advice and services."},
{"title": "How to sell a home during a divorce", "date": "9 November 2019", "Journal": "Toronto Star", "author": "Joe Richer OPINION", "wordscount": "473", "content": "My wife and I are divorcing. Are we each allowed our own agents in the sale of our home. How does this change the process of selling a property?\nSelling a matrimonial home as part of a divorce can be complicated - and emotional. It is not unusual for there to be an added layer of apprehension and perhaps even some uncertainty about how to navigate the selling process.\nIf spouses are unable to agree on one salesperson, then they can enter into what is called a co-listing agreement. This is an arrangement where each spouse has their own real estate salesperson responsible for negotiating in the best interest of the spouse they represent.\nThis approach can be very effective in helping both parties facilitate the amicable sale of their property, to ensure the interests of each are well represented, and may even help them to avoid unnecessary disputes.\nIn addition to facilitating the sale of the property, co-listing salespeople or brokers can also assist in ensuring that other legal requirements, such as holding proceeds from the sale in trust, are met and that other complex financial aspects, such as tax issues, are navigated.\nWhen selecting a salesperson or broker, there are a few things to note.\nThe first is that not all brokerages will consent to a co-listing arrangement, so you will want to find one that does. I recommend that you ask some questions about how the brokerages will handle the co-listing, including posting the listing, marketing and showing the property, reviewing offers and negotiating the closing date of a sale. Seek out a salesperson or broker who is experienced with co-listings that involve the disposition of a matrimonial home.\nAlso be sure to check in with your divorce lawyer before final decisions are made.\nEvery situation is unique. If you plan to sell your home as part of a marital separation, save yourself some headache - and heartache - by finding yourself a qualified real estate salesperson and a real estate lawyer that can help you through the process.\nIt's also worth noting that co-listing arrangements can also be arranged under other circumstances, for example: when two or more independent buyers are investing in a property.\nAs always, working with a salesperson or broker and a real estate lawyer is highly advisable when navigating the purchase or sale of a property.\nIf you have a question about the home buying or selling process, please email information@reco.on.ca\n.\nJoe Richer is registrar of the Real Estate Council of Ontario (RECO) and contributor for the Star.

{"title": "Market demand says that we get building", "date": "9 November 2019", "Journal": "Toronto Star", "author": "Dave Wilkes OPINION", "wordscount": "537", "content": "Like all markets, the housing market in Ontario is driven by the laws of supply and demand. Strong demand for housing has created a persistent supply challenge that can only be solved, simply, by boosting the number of new homes being built.\nThis approach makes sense. It is supported by numerous economists and academics. This is why the Building Industry and Land Development Association is encouraged by the provincial government's focus on boosting housing supply.\nEvery month, BILD releases the previous month's new home sales data, gathered by \nAltus Group\n, tracking the relative health of the new housing market as reflected in sales, inventory, price per square foot and comparisons to historical trends. The data we released for September pointed to a modest recovery from the slump of the previous year, but, given that new home sales and inventory increased in tandem, the data underscored that the GTA continues to experience a significant housing-supply crunch.\nIn previous columns, I have highlighted that the GTA is one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in North America, with an average of 115,000 net new residents per year. Our population is expected to reach 9.7 million by 2041. Given this robust growth in population, demand for housing of all types - to buy or rent - is strong and will remain so.\nThe challenge is that the supply side of the housing equation in Ontario is highly regulated and dependent on factors that can make it less responsive to demand signals. The first of these factors is the supply of land designated for residential construction and serviced with the appropriate infrastructure. Within the cities of the GTA, the amount of available lands for new residential construction has been steadily decreasing.\nAnother factor that restricts our housing supply relates to planning and approvals. New housing cannot simply be built any time, anywhere. All new housing projects go through a complex and lengthy approval process, subject to multiple pieces of provincial regulation, which is interpreted and administered by municipal governments.\nThis slows the supply side from being able to meet demand signals. As a result, in the GTA it takes on average of 10 years to complete a typical highrise project and 11 years to complete a typical lowrise project.\nLike a growing number of governments around the world, the Ontario provincial government has recognized that achieving balance in the housing market starts with increasing supply. The government recognizes that adding new homes helps moderate prices, creates trickle-down housing opportunities for those looking to enter the housing market and has a beneficial impact on the rental market.\nThis month, BILD will be highlighting some of the benefits of the province's Housing Supply Action Plan in a public education campaign called the Math is Simple.

That's a 14.8 per cent increase in the number of permits taken out during the same period in 2018, and a 34.2 per cent increase in the dollar value of those permits.\nSince the fee went into effect on May 1, 2017, the city has collected $26.7 million for new-home construction on the suburban edge.\nThe third-quarter results mark a reversal for the impact fee for 2019, where the revenue had declined for two straight quarters compared to 2018.\nThe impact fee was approved by council in October 2016, following a stormy debate between city hall and the new-home construction industry. The industry has since filed a legal challenge, which remains before court.\nThe fee is supposed to offset city costs associated with services required as a result of new development, including recreational and leisure facilities, transit and other infrastructure.\nWhile there has been pressure from Mayor Brian Bowman to spend the money, council decided to keep the revenue unspent in a dedicated reserve fund pending the outcome of the court case.\nThe initial rate in 2017 was $54.73 per square metre ($5,084 per 1,000 square feet). There was an automatic five per cent increase in the fee amount effective Jan. 1, 2018 ($57.47 per square metre, or $5,338 per thousand feet).\nAn increase of 3.5 per cent went into effect on Jan. 1 of this year, putting the rate at $59.48 per square metre, or $5,524.83 per thousand square feet.\nThere were 10 suburban areas where the fee was to be collected. To date, construction of new homes has only occurred in six of those areas.\nCouncil has to decide if, and when, the impact fee should be applied to other types of development (commercial, industrial, institutional) in those same 10 areas and, eventually, across the city.\nThe largest share of the permits, and the dollars collected, has come from new construction in Waverley West (35.7 per cent of permits, 34.6 per cent of dollars), with the remainder from: Old Kildonan (22.9 per cent permits, 24.9 per cent dollars), South St. Boniface (19.5 per cent permits, 19.2 per cent dollars), Transcona West (14.2 per cent permits, 12.9 per cent dollars) and Wilkes (7.6 per cent permits, 8.4 per cent dollars).\nThere was one permit taken out for a project in North Henderson.\naldo.santin@freepress.mb.ca"},

But the government agency that monitors the country's housing sector is no longer red-flagging the city, along with Toronto and Victoria, as having a \"high degree of vulnerability.\"\nIn its third quarter analysis released Thursday, CMHC says that \"the overall assessment for the Hamilton housing market has changed from a high to moderate degree of vulnerability as it now exhibits low evidence of overvaluation.\"\nToronto was also removed from the red-flag list for similar reasons. Only Victoria remains as an area of concern.\nPrice increases in 2016 and 2017 \"were not supported by employment, income and population growth,\" said Anthony Passarelli, a senior analyst with CMHC. \"Now a lot of those imbalances have gradually unwound with a strong local economy with very low unemployment and strong population growth because of immigration and people moving in from nearby communities like the GTA.\"\nAn interesting aspect of this is people who have moved to Hamilton, and commute to Toronto, tend to have higher wages than they could receive in Hamilton. Those higher wages allow them to better afford housing price increases the city has seen.\nRealtors Association of Hamilton-Burlington CEO Carol Ann Burrell says she agrees with the CMHC analysis.\n\"We started out the year in a much more balanced position than we experienced in 2016 and 2017, but the last few months have been favouring sellers,\" she said.\n\"We've seen that buyers are choosing more affordable property options, such as townhouses and apartments - as well as more affordable locations in the city, such as Hamilton centre and east. This has been the trend over the past year,\" she said.\nWhen it comes to the rental market, Burrell said, \"we have a lack of quality rental stock to meet the demand.\"\n\"As a city, we need to be looking at ways to increase rental affordability, such as making it easier for Hamiltonians to establish secondary suites in their homes.

(CMHC), which released its fourth-quarter Housing Market Assessment on Thursday.\n\"From an overall perspective there's still a moderate degree of vulnerability but, of course, with the overvaluation easing, that has led to our assessment coming in at moderate,\" said Dana Senagama, manager of market analysis for Ontario.\nBut while the market as a whole is at less risk, some housing types, such as condominiums, are still vulnerable to overheating and price acceleration, she added.\n\"While the activity has softened in the lowrise category, we are seeing heightened activity in the more price-friendly point for first-time buyers in condos and towns,\" said Senagama.\nAs overvaluation eased, home-buying activity has picked up since the first quarter of this year. The average home price increased by 0.8 per cent year over year in the second quarter of 2019 on an inflation-adjusted basis.\nDisposable income levels also grew by 0.5 per cent.\nThe region's first-time home-buying population, people aged 25 to 34, grew by 3.7 per cent compared to 1.9 per cent nationally.\n\"Supply continues to be the defining factor in the Toronto housing market - or rather the lack of supply - both in home ownership but also in rental,\" said Senagama.\nThere has been a tight supply in lowrise housing since CMHC started doing the Housing Market Assessment in the third quarter of 2015.\nBut as demand for condos continues to grow, it's increasingly an issue in that segment too, she said.\nCMHC's Housing Market Assessment uses four factors: overheating, price acceleration, overvaluation and overbuilding to assess the housing picture nationally and in 15 major metropolitan areas.\nThe latest report gives the national housing market a moderate rating for the third consecutive quarter, following 10 quarters where it was previously rated at a high degree of vulnerability.\nHamilton also saw its vulnerability rating drop from high to moderate, thanks to lower overvaluation.\n\"Overheating and price acceleration are still signalled due to large market imbalances that developed at the beginning of the latest three-year period. However, an unwinding of those imbalances has occurred since then,\" said the CMHC report.\nOvervaluation has been decreasing overall in Canada and in key markets such as Vancouver and Victoria, as well as Toronto, said CMHC chief economist Bob Dugan.\nAlthough the Victoria market is no longer considered to be overheated, it remains the only Canadian market in the red zone, due to price acceleration and overvaluation.\nHowever, those conditions are easing, Dugan said.\nVancouver remains moderately vulnerable with continuing overvaluation."},

So here the message is that long-term funding costs are decreasing and this is causing fixed rates to be low.\"\n\"Right now it would be an incentive to choose a fixed mortgage rate,\" Mandujano said.\nStill, the drop of Canadian fiveyear bond rates to 2014 levels of less than two per cent could \"re-incentivize mortgage credit growth in 2020,\" CMHC said.\nWhile CMHC said just one per cent of the house-buying market secures loans from mortgage investment corporations and private lenders, the higher stress tests may be driving interest in that route among riskier buyers.\nThe corporations have increased lending by about 10 per cent to $13 billion while the rest of the mortgage sector has risen just two per cent, CMHC said.\nMeantime, 14 per cent of mortgages are acquired through credit unions, and six per cent via mortgage finance companies, according to CMHC.\nDelinquency rates at mortgage investment companies and private lenders were highest at 1.92 per cent, compared to 0.23 per cent for the big banks and 0.16 per cent for credit unions.

Housing shows almost half of 13,182 affordable housing units earmarked for general affordability, rental, homelessness, Indigenous housing and women's transition support are still labelled in progress because they don't have the required funding or commitments to proceed.\nOnly 71 rental housing units have been completed by B.C. Housing out of a promised 1,598, according to the first quarter 2019-20 report. Delays are common, with 59 per cent of projects suffering minor or major delays.\nThe figures were contained in an internal B.C. Housing report that is updated quarterly.\nThe Opposition Liberals obtained a copy through freedom of information and raised it in question period at the legislature Thursday.\nThe questions put Housing Minister Selina Robinson on the defensive.\n\"After two years of this government, the NDP has built only 71 (rental) units in the entire province. At this rate it's going to take 100 years for you,\" said Liberal critic Jane Thornthwaite.\nRobinson attacked the previous government's record of supportive housing, saying the Liberals lack the credibility required to question her progress.\n\"Well, clearly, they don't understand how long it takes to build housing because they didn't do it,\" said Robinson. \"We have thousands of units that are in progress and under construction right across this province, but they wouldn't understand that it takes several months - in fact, a couple of years - to actually get them completed. So the fact that they would think that in nine months you would have housing completed is absolutely ridiculous.\"\nThe NDP promised in the 2017 election to build 114,000 affordable homes over the next 10 years.\nThe 2018 provincial budget earmarked $6.2 billion over that time to support 33,700 units, and called for partnerships with private-sector developers, other levels of government, non-profits and faith-based organizations to make up the rest. B.C. Housing's portion of the larger target is 28,700 units, of which 22 per cent are currently funded, in development or completed.

Making sure you get the support and advice you need throughout this exercise is a wise decision. Did you know that there's an organization working to keep you safe during your real estate transaction with a broker? The Organisme d'autor\u00e9glementation du courtage immobilier du Qu\u00e9bec (OACIQ) is the authority of real estate brokerage, and is a priceless resource for all members of the public as it provides support and information for buyers and sellers through every step of the real estate transaction process.\nAs mandated by the Quebec government, the role of the OACIQ is to enforce the Real Estate Brokerage Act in order to protect members of the public as they work with a real estate broker when buying or selling any type of property. The act governs the real estate brokerage practice in Quebec and provides the OACIQ with a range of instruments to assist and protect consumers before, during and after their transactions.\nIn addition to enforcing the act, the OACIQ is also responsible for overseeing the practices of brokers by supervising not just their operations, but also their continuing education. This constant renewal of information, coupled with training programs recognized by the OACIQ, rigorous certification exams and the inspections made by the OACIQ, ensures that brokers understand and respect the laws - and their ethical obligations - in a constantly changing landscape.\n\"The Mandatory Continuing Education Program implemented by the OACIQ in 2015 must be completed by all Quebec real estate brokers,\" said Sofy Bourret, vice-president of communications at the OACIQ. \"Its aim is to ensure that brokers'skills are optimal and regularly updated to properly assist their clients with all complex aspects of a real estate transaction - all while respecting the Real Estate Brokerage Act.\"\nThe OACIQ also regulates brokers'practice by requiring themtouseastandardsetof forms in all transactions. With over 50 mandatory and recommended forms available for just about any type of real estate transaction, the OACIQ has streamlined the process for buyers and sellers alike, ensuring that everything is done according to proper practices.\n\"When a broker presents you with an OACIQ form, you may be assured that this form has been validated at every stage and is constantly being updated. Brokers also have an obligation to explain each of the clauses in the forms they use so that you understand each aspect,\" Bourret said.\nThe OACIQ website has several tools available to help educate the public. For example, the site features the recently updated Digital Buyer's Guide and Digital Seller's Guide. The documents provide extensive details about a huge range of topics and were developed to help consumers better understand each step of the purchasing and selling process, as well as the role and obligations their real estate professionals should be fulfilling. \"Wehavecompletelyreviewed and improved our Buyer's and Seller's Guide to respond concretely to consumers'desire to be even better informed,\" Bourret said. \"Now, consumers have at their disposal an online tool that will guide them step by step through each stage of the process of purchasing a home, an income property, or a condo.\"\nIn addition to these resources, the OACIQ has many other mechanisms to support and guide members of the public during real estate transactions.\nFor example, the OACIQ Information Centre receives more than 53,000 requests each year. If you have questions about the services you're receiving or the transaction you're undertaking, the OACIQ Information Centre is the right place to start. The information agents are equipped to deal with a multitude of questions and concerns. Depending on the situation, callers will be directed to various resources available through the centre.\nThe OACIQ supervises brokers, and the law it enforces provides for several mechanisms of protection for consumers.

At the same time, the number of properties on the market has been dwindling.\nThe mismatch between supply and demand has pushed prices up and tilted the market in favour of sellers in most parts of Montreal. Yet Off-Island buyers have the upper hand when it comes to one type of property: single-family homes in Hudson and St-Lazare that are listed above $500,000.\nOff-Island homes priced under that magical half-million mark are selling briskly, according to the most recent Centris statistics released by the Quebec Professional Association of Real Estate Brokers, but there is a glut of more expensive properties on the market right now in Hudson and St-Lazare, meaning buyers can have their pick of properties.\nPart of the reason is rising prices have pushed more homes above the $500,000 price point. But it's also that many buyers are shopping Off-Island after being priced out of Montreal - and if they're spending about as much as they would to buy an apartment or townhouse on the Island, they're going to think twice whether the extra room is worth the commute.\nThe most recent \nRoyal LePage\n house price survey found prices in the Montreal area went up almost six per cent in the past year. Home prices Off-Island rose more slowly, increasing just 3.5 per cent (an increase of almost $12,000 in the median home price for the area, which is now pegged at $347,000).\nWhat's interesting is that less-expensive types of properties had the biggest gains in price. Two-storey homes in Vaudreuil and Soulanges showed only a slight increase of less than one per cent year-over-year. Bungalow prices, on the other hand, rose seven per cent while condos jumped nine per cent. The result? A buyer of a bungalow or condo priced in the middle of the market paid about $20,000 more than they would have if they bought a year ago. As I wrote in my last city column on Monday, the CMHC predicts that home prices in Montreal will keep rising for at least the next two years. If the trend continues, expect the competition for lower-priced homes to heat up. If the momentum continues, brace yourself: it could be that one day, half a million for a home will seem like a bargain.\nHOW MUCH HAVE PRICES GONE UP IN YOUR AREA? In the past five years, prices have been rising steadily. Here's how much the median house price has increased in West Island and Off-Island neighbourhoods since 2014:\n? West Island South (Senneville, Ste.-Anne-de-Bellevue, Baied'Urf\u00e9, Beaconsfield, Pointe-Claire and Dorval): 43 per cent\n? West Island North (\u00cele-Bizard, Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Kirkland, Dollard-des-Ormeaux): 19 per cent\n? \u00cele-Perrot (including NDIP, Pincourt and Terrasse-Vaudreuil): 27 per cent\n? Vaudreuil-Dorion (including Vaudreuil-sure-le-Lac and L'\u00cele-Cadieux): 27 per cent\n? Lazare, Hudson and Vaudreuil West: 16 per cen\nt ? Soulanges South (St.-Zotique, Les Coteaux, Coteau-du-Lac, Les C\u00e8dres and Pointe-des-Cascades): 5 per cent.

How does this work, and how can I be sure I'm getting top dollar for my property?\nThank you for your question. \u201cI'll sell your home, or I'll buy it,\u201d is a strategy used by some salespeople and brokerages when marketing their services to potential clients who want sell their home within a specific time frame.\nSigning on with a brokerage or sales rep using this technique can give sellers some peace of mind that their home will be sold by a date, and a price, they have agreed to. This can be helpful if you are a seller who:\nWants the assurance that, regardless of market conditions at the time you list your property and the interest potential buyers express in purchasing your home, you will receive a predetermined amount of money by a certain date.\nDoes not want to be exposed to the possibility of carrying two mortgages at the same time, should you enter into an agreement to buy another home prior to selling your existing one and are unable to secure bridge financing.\nThere are give and takes in this approach, and there are a few important things you will want to keep in mind when you are considering this type of listing arrangement.\nGuaranteed price and list price are not the same thing. The list price, or the price that your property would get on the open market, and the price a salesperson or brokerage would pay if the property is not sold, may not be the same. It is common to see terms where the seller and their sales agent or brokerage must agree on a guaranteed price and closing date at the time of listing. In some cases, the guaranteed price can be lower than what you could potentially get from a traditional buyer/seller transaction.\nBe sure to read the fine print. If listing your home with a \u201cWe'll sell it, our we'll buy it\u201d guarantee is a consideration, it is very important that you read and fully understand the agreement. In some cases, additional fees may be associated with the guaranteed purchase. I strongly recommend that you hire a real estate lawyer to review your contract before entering into such an agreement.\nI also want to note that a salesperson has a duty to actively seek out potential buyers for their client's home and handle price negotiations in their client's best interest.\nThe Real Estate Council of Ontario (RECO) expects real estate representatives and brokerages that engage in this marketing practice to dutifully uphold their fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of their client. This includes actively seeking out potential buyers for their client's property, and fulfilling promises and commitments made as a seller's representative throughout negotiations. If the sales guarantee program/offer comes to fruition they must fully disclose their personal interest in the purchase and document all conditions or fees.\nIf you have a question about the home buying or selling process, please email information@reco.on.ca[mailto:information@reco.on.ca].\nJoe Richer is registrar of the Real Estate Council of Ontario (RECO) and contributor for the Star.

{"title": "Housing starts, prices and sales to resume rise next year, CMHC says", "date": "25 October 2019", "Journal": "Vancouver Sun", "author": "Colin Mcclelland", "wordscount": "533", "content": "TORONTO The outlook is upbeat for housing in Canada next year with construction starts, sales and prices expected to rebound on the back of economic and demographic support, according to the country's largest public mortgage provider.\nHousing starts will range between 194,000 and 204,300 next year, showing a return to form after two years of declines, \nCanada Mortgage and Housing Corp\n. said in its annual housing market outlook released Thursday.\nThe number of sales may be as high as 497,700 next year, while the average price will be between $506,200 and $532,000, the agency forecast. That's up from a forecast of as much as $497,200 for 2019.\n\"Housing starts will stabilize in 2020 and 2021 for Canada as a whole,\" Bob Dugan, CMHC's chief economist, said on a conference call. \"Existing home sales will remain essentially flat in 2019, up ever-so slightly from the level we saw last year. However, sales will then start to increase, offsetting much of the recent declines that we've seen by 2021.\"\nThe economy will boost housing market demand after a soft 2019 with gross domestic product growth of 1.5 per cent. Canada's economy is expected to increase expansion to two per cent next year and 1.9 per cent in 2021, CMHC said. That will lead to a gradual increase in interest rates in late 2020, it said. The benchmark rate has remained at 1.75 per cent after four increases by the \nBank of Canada\n since late last year.\nCMHC said risks to its projections would be increased trade tensions that impact business and investor confidence and subsequent economic and housing market activity. Instability could also increase with higher household indebtedness affected by higher interest rates or joblessness, it said.\n\"The level of debt in Canada is high,\" Dugan said. \"Should there be some sort of a shock that causes unemployment to rise or the level of employment to drop that can really have an impact on the performance of loans.\"\nRelatively strong economic growth and housing demand in British Columbia will see housing starts there outperform other regions in Canada, though at levels below recent highs, CMHC said.\nThe outlook for existing home sales growth for next year and 2021 is strongest in B.C. and Ontario because of rising disposable income forecast to exceed the national average, the agency said. Ontario is expected to lead price increases over the two years followed by Quebec, according to the agency. B.C. will see a modest price recovery in 2020 after a decline this year because of foreign ownership rules and mortgage stress tests, but the province will assume the second-fastest price growth after Ontario in 2021, CMHC said.\nStrong economic conditions in cities such as Vancouver and Toronto create demand for housing and increases prices, a situation that's exacerbated because the housing supply is relatively unresponsive to price changes, Dugan said. Part of the solution is to address land costs by offering larger homes in the condominium market, he said. Financial Post"},
{"title": "Housing market to continue recovery into 2021, according to CMHC report", "date": "25 October 2019", "Journal": "Edmonton Journal", "author": "Jason Herring", "wordscount": "449", "content": "Alberta's housing market is poised to continue its slow recovery from the recession spurred by low oil prices in late 2014, according to a new report from Canada's national housing agency.\n\n\nThe Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp\n. released its annual housing market outlook Thursday, reporting that housing starts in Edmonton are projected to have a moderate increase next year before slowing in 2021.\nAnd though a small rise in house prices is expected, the high level of inventory means the city will continue to be a buyer's market, according to CMHC senior analyst Pershing Sun.\n\"One of the most long-standing features of Edmonton's housing market is that the inventory has long been higher than national average,\" said Sun.\nThe total number of housing starts in Edmonton has remained steady over the past three years, with 10,036 in 2016, 11,435 in 2017 and 10,038 in 2018. A small increase is possible in 2019, with a low-end estimate of 10,946 new starts and a high-end forecast of 12,213.\n\"We did see a bit of an increase in terms of absorption of inventory in the apartment market,\" Sun said.\n\"That has stimulated a bit more construction and that's one of the patterns that led to a bit of a modest increase in terms of our projections in overall construction.\"\nA potential problem the report flags is that housing construction is expected to outpace demand. That trend is expected to lead to home sales and prices stabilizing in 2020 and slowing after that.\nOn the rental side of things, the CMHC projects the market to tighten, with vacancy rates to trend lower and rent to trend higher over 2020, caused by both a lack of supply and increased demand for rental housing. Ongoing rental unit construction should ease the market in 2021,though.\n\"The vacancy rate is expected to trend lower because we're seeing Edmonton start to regain some net migration, which will stimulate rental demand,\" Sunsaid. \"On the supply side, we do see recent rental constructions in the first two quarters of 2019. As most of the rental construction becomes available to the market, that will expand supply.\"\nThe city's rental vacancy rate declined from seven per cent to 5.3 per cent from 2017 to 2018. In 2019, that number is expected to drop to 3.9 percent. That trend is projected to continue with a3.4 per cent vacancy rate in 2020 before increasing to 4.3 per cent in 2021. jherring@postmedia.com twitter.com/jasonfherring"},

Launches like Skyview Place Building 1000 and 2000 by Carlisle Group in the outer north of the city, which added 272 new units to the market, helped ease supply.\nIn the city's central areas, like the Beltline, the addition of new projects like SODO and the Underwood also helped keep rents stable.\nIndeed both were well received, Daggett adds. All 305 units of SODO have been leased while the Underwood is more than 50 per cent leased.\nRenters have a bevy of options, which is putting pressure on older rental properties in close proximity to newly launched ones. Among those facing challenges is Portfolio, located near the Underwood.\n\"The new product is definitely drawing away people for sure,\" Daggett says.\nOne reason why new projects, particularly in the downtown, are attractive is they offer plenty of amenities.\nThese offerings allow developers to charge premium rents for smaller floor plans, and target white collar professionals who work in the downtown.\nIn contrast, new projects on the outskirts have fewer amenities, but offer larger floor plans to cater to families.\n\"But we did see in Skyview Place that the developers included a gym, so we're even seeing in the outskirts a focus on amenities, too,\" she says.\nDespite the easing rental rates from the previous quarter, rents were still higher from the same quarter in 2018, Daggett says.\n\"Compared to the third quarter of 2018, we've increased by 2.5 per cent there.\"\nShe adds that 2019 is a \"weird year\" so far compared with last year when occupancy and rates rose in tandem.\n\"Last year's conditions were easy to grasp,\" she says. \"But this year, we saw Q1 start fairly reasonable to the last quarter of 2018, and then we had a big jump in Q2, and now Q3 is back down.\"\nWhile rates were down in Q3, occupancy also fell to 91 per cent, the lowest point in more than 12 months.\nDaggett adds that year-over-year increases in rental rates, however, are a positive sign for developers. And this metric may also have silver linings for renters as they can expect even more selection in the future.\nProjects including Telus Sky by West Bank and the Windsor by Arlington Street Investments - all slated to launch soon - will add to supply, increasing competition for renter dollars.\n\"We have quite a few development nearing completion,\" Daggett says.\n\"So there are lots of choices for renters, whether they want to live in the Beltline or on the outskirts.\""},

(CMHC).\n\"Since 2018, we've seen interprovincial migration go positive and we're seeing some strong employment gains,\" said Pardy.\n\"Going into 2020, we should see some improvements.\"\nIn 2018, single-detached home housing starts reached 3,791, a number that could hit as high as 4,400 next year and 4,900 in 2021, states the CMHC.\nThe figure for new multiple-family homes - condos, duplexes - could tick up by 200 to 300 from the 7,180 units built in 2018, says the report.\nBut that growth will remain checked by high inventories in both the new and resale home markets, said Pardy.\n\"It's going to take some time to get through that,\" he said.\nMLS sales that came in at 20,354 are forecast to reach up to 21,500 next year and as high as 25,800 in 2021, said Pardy.\nThat outlook is being driven by a growth in Calgary job numbers, a gain of 50,000 over the past year, he said.\n\"That's a six per cent gain, that's very strong and the vast majority of those have been full-time jobs,\" said Pardy.\n\"That's very positive in getting people into housing.\"\nMost of the employment gains have been in the service sector, but also in scientific and tech-related positions, a sign of diversification badly needed while the energy sector continues to shed jobs, he said.\n\n\nStatistics Canada\n says both foreign and interprovincial migration to Alberta has recently picked up for the first time since 2014, when the energy industry was flying high before crashing later that year.\nMost of that influx naturally heads to the province's larger centres, stimulating the housing market, said Pardy.\n\"Economic diversity in Calgary is much greater than smaller centres,\" he said.\nBut that still relatively sluggish economy is holding back average resale prices, which, at $460,619 for a single-detached home last year, is forecast to be $451,600 by 2021.\nBut that's an improvement over the $438,800 average predicted for this year, said Pardy.\n\"They seem to be plateauing but we still have larger inventories,\" he said.\nThe local economy could be transitioning to an employment growth at a pay grade lower than during the oil and gas heydays, which is reflected in housing market trends, said Ann-Marie Lurie, chief economist with the Calgary Real Estate Board.\n\"We're moving into almost the new normal, we need something to shift in our economy to get that big boost,\" she said.\n\"Where we're seeing improvements in the housing market is in the lower end, below $500,000.\"\nAny improvements owe more to shrinking supply than increasing demand, said Lurie.\nAnd she noted, the lion's share of newcomers to Calgary come from foreign sources, which has less effect on the new housing side.\n\"Those are not translating into ownership demand as quickly,\" she said.\nCurrently, the average price of single-detached homes is seven per cent below 2014 levels, with multi-family homes 15 per cent below their value five-and-a-half years ago, said Lurie.\nAnother factor buoying the market slightly, she said, is a reduced rental vacancy rate.\nLurie said there's a risk that austerity coming in the provincial budget could negatively affect the housing sector with job cuts or freezes.\n\"Most of the job growth has been generated by education, health care and the public administration domains,\" she said.

{"title": "Big Losers in Federal Election Could be Foreign Homebuyers and Homeowners", "date": "23 October 2019", "Journal": "Vancouver Sun", "author": "Geoff Zochodne", "wordscount": "773", "content": "TORONTO The biggest losers of Monday's federal election may not be a political party, but foreign homebuyers and homeowners, who are facing the possibility of new taxes levied on them by a Liberal minority government supported by the NewDemocrats.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberals vowed in their platform to \"limit the housing speculation that can drive up home prices\" with a national tax on vacant homes owned by non-Canadians who are not living inCanada. According to a backgrounder, the Liberals are aiming to charge an annual one-per-cent tax, modelling it on a similar measure already in place in BritishColumbia.\n\"In every decision we make as your government, we will always put this country and its people first,\" Trudeau declared in his victoryspeech.\nBut the Liberals are heading back to Ottawa 13 members of parliament short of majority status in the 338-seat House ofCommons. To pass legislation, a Liberal minority government will need to cobble together support from otherparties.\nA possible, perhaps even likely, partner for the Liberals is the NDP, which secured 24 seats in the election and whose platform also promised to fight real-estatespeculation. Instead of an annual tax on foreign homeowners, the New Democrats and leader Jagmeet Singh pledged a 15-per-cent foreign buyer's tax on the sale of homes to non-Canadians or people who are not permanentresidents.\nIn his concession speech Singh said he had spoken to Trudeau and \"let him know that we'll be working hard on making sure we deliver the priorities that Canadianshave.\"\nHe later added, \"We want to help Canadians be able to get a home that they canafford.\"\nNeither the Liberal nor NDP proposal may be enough to slam the brakes on a Canadian housing market that has continued to gainmomentum. Home sales increased15.5 per cent in September from a year earlier, the \nCanadian Real Estate Association\n reported thismonth.\n\"The vacancy tax will create a nuisance for mobile homeowners and will generate a modest revenue source for the government, but it is unlikely to have broader economic impacts,\" noted Rebekah Young, director of fiscal and provincial economics at the Bank of NovaScotia. \"Otherwise, the leading party has so far resisted broader measures pitched by other parties that would further fuel priceescalation.\n\"An NDP alliance would put welcomed pressure on accelerating supply side solutions but its broad-based foreign buyer's tax proposal warrantscaution.\"\nThe Liberals'proposed vacancy tax received a cool reception from industry when it was announced inSeptember. Now, however, the ambitions of the Liberals and NDP to do something about housing speculation, as well as their likely alliance, increases the probability of some kind oftax.\nTime may still be limited to implement a newtax. Analysts from Citi noted Tuesday that recent Canadian minority governments have fallen within an average of two years, sending voters back to the polls well ahead of the usual four-year run of a majoritygovernment.\nTrudeau also vowed to expand the first-time homebuyer incentive, a shared-equity mortgage with the government, to try to help would-be owners in hotter real estate markets such as the Greater Toronto and Vancouverareas.\nA \nBank of Canada\n survey of senior loan officers released Tuesday found lower interest rates had prompted greater demand for mortgages in the thirdquarter. That demand, the survey found, is expected to ratchet up further in the fourth quarter, in part because of the government's first-time homebuyerincentive.\nThe Liberal platform's proposals \"are only likely to add further fuel\" to housing prices at a time when the market has already been picking up steam, according to Toronto-Dominion Bank senior economist BrianDePratto.\n\"The federal government is by and large limited to demand-related measures,\" he said in anote. \"Some parts of the Liberal platform, such as a one-per-cent annual foreign buyer vacancy/speculation tax (echoing B.C.'s measures on this front), may help to moderate demand, but others appear set to stokeit.\""},
{"title": "Buying a home? Here's how to decide how much to put down", "date": "21 October 2019", "Journal": "Hamilton Spectator", "author": "", "wordscount": "943", "content": "Housing prices are ticking up again, with the average price for homes sold in September in the GTA reaching $843,115, according to the latest report.\nRising prices present prospective home buyers with a dilemma when it comes to saving for a down payment. Putting down the minimum five per cent on a $500,000 home gets you into the housing market for a reasonable $25,000. Saving up a 20 per cent down payment, on the other hand, avoids costly mortgage default insurance premiums (mortgage loan insurance from \nCanada Mortgage and Housing Corporation\n).\nNote that the minimum amount required for a down payment depends on the purchase price of your home. Homes valued at $500,000 or less need a down payment of five per cent, while homes valued between $500,000 and $999,999 require five per cent on the first $500,000 and 10 per cent for the portion above $500,000. Home buyers need to put down 20 per cent on homes valued at $1 million or more.\nThere are pros and cons putting down more or less on your home purchase. I reached out to Robert McLister, mortgage expert and founder of RateSpy.com, to discuss house down payment options.\nFive Per Cent Down\nPros: The obvious advantage to making the minimum five per cent down payment is there's less capital required to become a homeowner and reaching that threshold requires less time to save.\n\"So many young buyers stay on the sidelines scrimping for a bigger down payment only to see home prices run away from them,\" says McLister.\nHe points to the past two decades of price growth as evidence that getting into the market quicker can pay off, \"provided homebuyers don't overextend themselves.\"\nPutting down less than 20 per cent requires the buyer to purchase mortgage loan insurance to protect the lender against default. While the borrower must pay those insurance premiums, McLister says an advantage to having an insured mortgage is that it gives purchasers access to the lowest interest rates available.\nA five per cent down payment is also compatible with the First Time Home Buyers' Incentive - the shared equity mortgage with the \nGovernment of Canada\n - and other governmental home subsidies.\nA deliberately smaller down payment can leave a borrower with a larger cash cushion, saving for more immediate closing costs and furnishings, or simply retaining more money for emergencies and other needs.\nAnother advantage is that automatic monthly mortgage payments create a forced savings plan for those who might otherwise squander that money as a renter.\nCons: The financial impact of putting the minimum amount down on your home is that it comes with a four per cent default insurance premium. While this amount can be rolled into the mortgage, it creates a highly leveraged situation with risk of negative equity should home prices fall.\n\"On Day One you're almost 99 per cent financed. It doesn't take much of a home price selloff to trap you in your home, preventing a sale,\" said McLister.\nA five per cent down payment also means more interest expense over the life of your mortgage, compared to a larger down payment.\nNote that the amortization for buyers with five per cent down is limited to 25 years. The property also cannot be a non-owner-occupied rental property.\nAnother caveat to consider: Prospective home buyers can borrow the five per cent down payment (even from a credit card) so long as they meet the lender's debt limit ratio. The big red flag on this means, \"they can essentially owe more than their home price on Day One,\" said McLister.\n20 Per Cent Down\nPros: The primary advantage of putting down 20 per cent or more on a home is to avoid default insurance premiums, saving thousands of dollars over the life of the mortgage.\nA larger down payment offers more flexibility, giving buyers the ability to purchase a home priced at $1 million or more, and allowing for amortizations over 25 years, along with refinancing.\nPutting 20 per cent down gives buyers more product choices, such as re-advanceable mortgages, standalone home equity lines of credit, interest-only mortgages and non-prime financing.\nBuyers with 20 per cent down also avoid the federal mortgage stress tests if they use a credit union or alternative lender.\nCons: A 20 per cent down payment ties up more of an investor's capital, which comes with an opportunity cost - there will be less money for moving costs or renovations.\nIt also subjects most borrowers to a stricter stress test if they use a bank, since the mortgage would be uninsured.\n\"The uninsured stress test equals the greater of the (\nBank of Canada\n's) benchmark rate or your contract rate plus two per cent, whereas the insured stress test is just the benchmark rate,\" said McLister.\nFinally, a 20 per cent deposit is typically required for many new build properties.\nIn summary, McLister said, the size of the down payment shouldn't only be dictated by available resources, but by investment alternatives.\n\"Often times it makes more sense to put less down so you can allocate cash to purposes with a higher return on investment.\"\nRobb Engen is a Lethbridge, Alta.-based writer and a freelance contributing columnist for the Star.

Everyone laughed", "date": "20 October 2019", "Journal": "Toronto Star", "author": "Joanna Chiu Star Vancouver", "wordscount": "1588", "content": "VANCOUVER -- The Star Vancouver's Joanna Chiu is hunting for a home in Vancouver. Join her as she navigates one of the country's tightest real estate markets in a series of stories that will examine the challenges faced by a generation of prospective home buyers.\nVANCOUVER-I lived overseas for most of the past decade, but every time I came home to Vancouver, it seemed like all everyone talked about were the soaring rents and housing prices.\nI overheard people squabbling over the reasons why, trying not to sound racist as the topic of wealthy newcomers came up, and bemoaning their increasingly long commutes as roads, buses and trains filled up with more and more humans.\nThat's why when I returned home last year, I didn't even try to hunt for a place. I took one look at \nCraigslist\n, spied the eye-watering rents (did they accidentally add an extra \"0\" to the listings?) and quickly accepted an offer from my parents to stay for $500 a month in a basement rental suite in a home they own in South Burnaby.\nIt was a steal, obviously, and my cat didn't mind it with all the juicy wolf spiders to catch, but after I got a job at the Star Vancouver newsroom, my daily trek downtown involved a 30-minute walk and one transfer in rush-hour traffic for a total of more than two hours a day shuffling around instead of breaking news.\nAhead of the federal election on Monday, candidates are making various promises about how they will address Metro Vancouver's housing crisis. As a journalist, I can say housing affordability is definitely top of mind for many voters here.\nIn Hong Kong, the most expensive housing market in the world, the average cost of a typical apartment in a new building is a staggering $2 million. As a result, most people in Hong Kong live in truly tiny rentals, with the worst-off languishing in metal cages like rabbits, their enclosed bed-hutches stacked on top of another in filthy shared rooms.\nBut in Metro Vancouver, as high as housing prices have risen in the past decade, they haven't yet reached truly absurd stratospheric levels, and recent government cooling measures - such as the foreign-buyers' tax and mortgage stress tests - seemed to have nudged prices down. The latest numbers show a 5.2 per cent drop in prices for housing in the region, when comparing the summer of 2019 with the same three months last year.\nThis spring, I read a colleague's story about a developer offering a year's supply of avocado toast to condo buyers, and it got me thinking. Surely the market must be down if developers are desperate enough to bribe people with toast. Maybe owning a home close to downtown is possible for a hardworking early 30s millennial like me.\nHowever, when I went through my housing wish list with my colleagues, everyone burst out laughing.\nI want a one-bedroom in a new, pet-friendly building for under $500,000. It should be near a central skytrain station, have a parking space for visitors, a gym, a full kitchen with fancy countertops and, preferably, an ocean or mountain view. My budget is far below Vancouver's benchmark apartment unit price of around $651,500.\nThe city of Vancouver also has the highest average monthly rent in Canada for a two-bedroom home ($2,915), and the fourth highest for one-bedrooms ($1,828), according to a recent report from Rentals.ca.\nUndeterred, I found an experienced real estate agent, Hannah Horlings of Zolo Realty, who told me she was confident she could find me places that match as many of my criteria as possible. She wasn't expecting to contend with my parents and their feng shui expertise.\nI don't know about other communities, but in Chinese-Canadian households, you don't make decisions like home purchases without the blessing of your elders, who often conveniently insist on helping with the down payment.\n\"It smells dead in here,\" my dad loudly whispered to me in Cantonese when we went for a showing in New Westminster.\n\"There are jagged structures in the skyline that look like knives. Hard no.\"\nOf course, the listing agent understood Cantonese, and she blushed and averted her eyes while we debated.\n\"But the foldaway murphy guest bed!\" I protested. \"And the pull-out kitchen table that extends from the countertop! This is a whole lot of function for 420 square feet!\"\nThis summer, Hannah showed me a decent-sized place in a new development a few blocks away from the edge of Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, an area afflicted by poverty. I really liked the place - the communal garden even had a view of the Burrard Inlet. But this time, it was a male friend who vetoed my choice, saying it's still risky at night for a single woman.\n\"You're going to get knifed.\"\n\"OK ... \"\nMonths into my search, home ownership seems further away than my daily commute to work, which is about to get a lot more pungent as winter sets in and everyone gets sausage-stuffed into train carriages with their wet raincoats and puffy jackets.\nEven if it proves impossible, maybe as a journalist I can at least learn something about our housing market from these efforts, as I keep searching for my dream home.\nBut as I sat down to write this story to chronicle what I learned, guilt set in that I have the fortune to even aspire to property ownership.\nVancouver has changed a lot, and changed quickly, with most people's salary increases not coming close to the surge in cost of living.\nProperty ownership is far out of reach for most millennials in Vancouver, with the average price of a home about four times higher than what young prospective buyers could realistically afford to pay.\nSince I started my career overseas, even though rent was still high, my other daily costs were very low. I biked everywhere in Beijing, for example, and a delectable lunch could usually cost less than $5.\nI need to look more closely at my life and the other privileges I enjoy. My current monthly rent is $500, for Pete's sake.\nBecause my parents paid for my university education and covered my rent most of the time, too, I was able to save some of the money I made from part-time work as a student.\nTypically, immigrant parents tend to sacrifice a lot to make sure their children have everything they need to succeed. As a teenager, my parents forbade me from working at the mall. We weren't rich, but they still gave me spending money so I could focus on getting good grades.\nIt's true that later in our lives, Asian children are expected to spend a significant amount of time and money taking care of our parents in their old age, but when you can get such a great head start in life, it's just way easier than starting to invest later after paying off debts like student loans.\nI've always done the side hustles, too, taking on part-time gigs throughout my 20s. Chugging coffee, I often stayed up past midnight after already working long hours at my day job in order to squirrel away funds for travelling and investments.\nAnd taking on a mortgage would beat forking over thousands of dollars in rent each month to a landlord and helping them with their sky-high mortgages.\nEarlier this month, I phoned my friend Amanda Reaume, a financial writer and author of books for younger readers, like \"The Complete Guide to a Debt-Free Education.\"\nI told her about my increasing ambivalence about home ownership, and she told me it was very common for people to feel guilty about wanting to make money, invest and acquire assets, particularly in a place like Vancouver, which has a high level of income inequality.\nBut she reminded me that \"wealth is something that can be used as a tool. It can be used to enrich only yourself and your immediate family or leveraged as a tool to make a greater impact for the community and causes you care about later on.\n\"There's nothing about money - or having it or not having it - that makes you good or bad.\"\nThanks for joining me on my odyssey through the overpriced homes of Vancouver. Future topics may include my puzzlement over the term \"junior one-bedroom,\" the collective \"lifestyle creep\" that Vancouverites have experienced and examinations of the different ways that young tenants and homeowners get raw deals when trying to find their dream homes.\nI will also travel to B.C.'s interior to visit my friends who have given up on Vancouver to settle down in smaller towns, taunting me with their beautiful fireplaces and actual front and backyards.\nAnd, if you have tips on where I can find a fantastic pad at rock-bottom prices, let me know!"},

But getting there involves some important considerations unlike any other purchase one will make.\nCareful thought around financing, affordability, home styles, finishes, and timeframes will all better-prepare first-time buyers for their online or in-person look into what's on the market.\nWhen considering a new build, there's a relationship between the buyer's timeframe for moving and their priorities around interior finishes.\nPeople who need to take possession of their new place, for example, within a few weeks, can go with a completed spec home, says Dave Armstrong, director of sales and marketing, northern Alberta for StreetSide Developments.\nHowever, being complete, it may not have the colour scheme that matches what the buyer had in mind.\n\"They might like the flooring, the countertops, and the paint, but you might not love the backsplash,\" says Armstrong.\nThis changes with a longer-range need for possession, where there's an opportunity to add finishes they prefer.\n\"If you can plan it out, and prebuild, then you can make all of our selections and you can get exactly what you want,\" says Armstrong, adding, while timelines change depending on the product, generally, \"in six to eight months, you should be able to pick everything.\"\nBased on affordability, first-time buyers commonly choose apartment-style condos, townhomes, and duplexes.\nIn making a decision about the type of home, Armstrong says it's important to know the \"type of living you want.\"\n\"A lot of people are very busy nowadays. Do they want a unit with a condo fee or (without condo fees) - familiarize yourself with both, and determine what's right for you,\" he adds.\nDepending on the development, condo fees typically cover, among other expenses, exterior maintenance, landscaping, and contributions to its reserve fund.\nAll apartments have condo fees, but townhomes can either be part of a condo management structure, or free-hold, which means the buyer owns the exterior of their home and the land it sits on, and is therefore responsible for the upkeep of these areas.\nTouring show homes can be a helpful part of a house hunter's research. Beyond demonstrating a floor plan, it can give a potential buyer a broader look at what they can expect from a development.\n\"When you go and look at a show home, it's one thing to look at home that particular model flows and how it lives,\" Armstrong says. \"But if you don't like that floor plan, that show home still shows you the level of finishing and build quality that builder can deliver.\"\nWhile it's natural for an apartment or townhome buyer to look into how it lines up with their needs today, planning for that next step can pay off.\n\"We're seeing some very educated first time home buyers come out and say 'I want to buy this townhome, I only want to live in it for five years, and then I'd like it to be a rental.'\"You should take that into consideration when putting in your finishes,\" he adds, singling out luxury vinyl flooring as an example of a durable option. \"We have a lot of really high-quality, low-maintenance finishes nowadays compared to what we had in the past.\"\nBut before pouring through home options, it's important for the buyer to know what they can afford.\n\"I think the first step is to start the conversation with a mortgage professional as early as possible,\" says Reema Kaushik, mortgage adviser with CIBC. \"That's one common mistake. At the time of the home purchase, (some) just assume that they are ready to buy a home. Mortgage advisers can support them by helping them understand what they'll be pre-qualified for, what to expect, and support them with the home-buying process. Also, it's important to figure out what they can afford, take time to understand the financial picture, focusing on areas such as income, affordability, debt payments, credit history and savings.\"\nA substantial new benefit to people taking their first step in home ownership, says Kaushik is the first time home buyer's incentive program rolled out by the federal government last month.\n\"We've recently helped people who had difficulty qualifying in the past because of capacity issues,\" she adds. \"It not only reduces mortgage payments for people, but it also reduces the insurance premiums.\"\nWhile the type of mortgage can depend on a handful of factors - such as needs and budget - Kaushik generally encourages \"firsttime home buyers, especially, to go for a stronger commitment of a fixed rate.\"\n\"People have a certain budget in their mind to make payments every month, especially first-time buyers.\""},

While all fared well in some areas, including addressing harmful demand that artificially inflates prices, they scored poorly overall.\n\"All the parties are making some of the advances toward the goal (of affordability),\" says Paul Kershaw, founder of Generation Squeeze, and a professor at the School of Population Health at UBC.\n\"But none are advancing ideas that will get us there quick enough, and that's because no party has come to terms with the fundamental tension.\"\nThat \"tension\" is the result of Canadians - Albertans included - still wanting to have it both ways with their home.\n\"We've wanted housing to be a home and we've wanted housing to be an excellent performer in our investment portfolios,\" he says.\n\"In other words, we've wanted home values to grow faster to the economy, but you can't have both.\"\nOverall, all parties scored worse than four out of 10 on Generation Squeeze's methodology that looked at promises for boosting market supply, reducing harmful demand and improving affordability.\nThis is largely because none has addressed the issue of prices growing faster than income, he says. While rapid price growth benefited baby boomers, it has made ownership much more challenging for their adult children.\nEven Calgary and Edmonton have not been immune to the problem, despite prices coming down in the last few years.\n\"Sure, there's a difference in the market in Alberta compared with B.C. and Ontario,\" he says.\nIn major centres like Vancouver and Toronto, the dream of ownership is almost out of reach for younger generations, Kershaw adds. But the data also suggest housing is less affordable for today's young Albertans than it was four decades ago.\nOn average in Canada it took an adult, between ages 25 and 34, five years of full-time work to save a 20 per cent down payment on an average priced home in 1978. Today it takes 13 years. And in Vancouver and Toronto, it's 29 and 21 years respectively.\nBy comparison, it takes 10 years in Calgary, and in Edmonton, it's nine years.\nKershaw does note Generation Squeeze's work is based on 2018 figures, acknowledging Alberta has been in the midst of a price slump that has extended into 2019.\nFor example, Edmonton prices fell more than six per cent last month, year over year, Realtors Association of Edmonton data show.\nAnd the media priced home in Calgary fell almost three per cent year over year, Calgary Real Estate Board statistics show.\n\"The stabilization in home prices has been helpful for buyers, but it's also happened in the context of a broader economic downturn,\" Kershaw says.\nSo while Albertans have seen home prices fall, they haven't seen their income rise.\nIn fact, Generation Squeeze data show, after accounting for inflation, young Albertans'average income has remained constant over four decades while home prices have almost doubled.\n\"So that tells you we haven't seen good wage growth to capitalize on those home prices,\" Kershaw says."},
{"title": "Does transit infrastructure elevate housing prices?; If it's underground, the answer is usually yes, but price gains are never a sure thing, Murtaza Haider and Stephen Moranis say", "date": "18 October 2019", "Journal": "Ottawa Citizen", "author": "Murtaza Haider And Stephen Moranis", "wordscount": "803", "content": "Billions of dollars are being spent on the construction of new public transit across Canada and the leading political parties have promised even more transit funding during the current election campaign.\nWhile new infrastructure is bound to reshape the mobility landscape in cities where such investments are made, it also can influence property values, especially those in the vicinity of newly constructed stations.\nExisting research shows that housing located near rail-based urban transit fetches higher prices than comparable homes located farther away.\nBut with new transit lines being extended deeper into suburbia, should land and property owners expect windfall gains? The answer to this question is not that simple. Even though academic and professional literature demonstrates that property values appreciate when efficient and reliable transit service becomes available nearby, the increase in values is not necessarily uniform.\nBesides, proximity to transit lines can have some downsides as well. First, during the construction of new transit infrastructure, which often takes years to complete, access to nearby properties and businesses is compromised. Second, construction-related disturbances, such as noise, dust and vibrations, affect the well-being of neighbours. Third, post-construction, homes located on streets leading to and from transit stations experience more traffic and noise because of buses and other vehicles headed to the stations.\nDespite the nuances, proximity to rail-based transit operating on a dedicated right-of-way, such as subways, often comes with a premium.\nWriting in the journal Urban Studies in 1983, Vladimir Bajic was one of the first to explore the sources of that premium in an analysis of the impact of Toronto's Spadina subway line (now known as the University Line), which started operating in 1978. Bajic, whose study has served as a template for future scholarship on the subject, found that the commuting time savings from the improved transit service contributed to the increase in neighbouring housing prices.\nThe study concluded that the \"savings in commuting costs which accrue to the commuters have been transferred to the homeowners through the complex workings of the urban housing market,\" resulting in a higher value of nearby properties.\nNumerous studies in Canada and elsewhere have reached similar conclusions. A study published in 2019 in Real Estate Economics investigated the impact of a new subway line on housing prices in Shanghai. The study found that the commuting benefits from the new subway line contributed to an average increase of 3.75 per cent in housing prices.\nSimilarly, a Masters thesis completed in 2018 at \nConcordia University\n explored whether proximity to elevated transit stations in Toronto and Vancouver carried a lower price premium than proximity to below-grade transit. The research found that properties listed near the \"elevated TTC subway and SkyTrain stations had, on average, lower listing prices while properties located in proximity to underground stations had higher listing prices.\"\nAbove-grade rail transit generates noise and is often not visibly appealing. Thus, the price premium was found to be lower for properties near above-grade stations compared to belowgrade stations.\nCan one assume that any rail-based transit infrastructure investment will lead to higher property values? The answer depends upon the benefits of the new transit service. If the new transit delivers travel time savings and comfort, it will attract new riders, induce real estate development on nearby undeveloped land, and contribute to higher house prices of neighbouring properties. But when the transport benefits are not realized, housing price premiums can fail to materialize as well.\nGary Wagner and co-authors analyzed the impact of light-rail transit on residential properties in the Hampton Roads region in Virginia. Their findings, published in Regional Science and Urban Economics in 2017, revealed that light-rail transit \"experienced disappointing levels of ridership compared to other light-rail systems.\" Consequently, the new light-rail line, instead of boosting house prices, was associated with a decline of eight per cent in the price of nearby properties.\nFor suburban and urban communities across Canada eagerly awaiting the launch of new rail-based transit systems, the implications are clear: Price gains are likely in the long run, but never a sure thing.

Given that would mean a 50 per cent increase to the nearly 13,500 social housing units in Hamilton, it's easy to see why some people have to wait years for a spot.\n\"We're in the midst of a housing crisis,\" said Edward John, the city's director of housing. \"The irony being we've known about it for 30 years. We've been talking about it without putting the money where the issue is.\"\n\"Housing is absolutely a human right, in my opinion, and we should all share the burden of making sure our most vulnerable people are looked after,\" John added.\nKeith Alarie is one of the many thousand waiting in Hamilton for a subsidized apartment.\nThe 57-year-old had been on the wait list a few years ago, but feeling discouraged, let his information lapse. Three months ago, he decided to give it another shot. \"I know it will be a while yet.\"\nAlarie, who gets by on a $1,166 monthly disability cheque, rents a basement room in a home on Wilson Street for $600.\nHe struggled to get the landlord to fix leaks in his unit and has to use a kitchen in the main-floor unit. \"I'd like to be able to do things on my own, cook my own meals and that.\"\nThere are worrisome pressures rippling through all parts of the housing ecosystem - from the steady increase in house prices, to sharply rising rents, to the lack of government-subsidized rental housing, to the lack of new rental units being built.\nOn top of that, there's been the gentrification of older, inner-city neighbourhoods that were traditionally a source of more affordable housing.\nBut as with most social problems, the brunt of the burden is borne by those at the bottom of the pyramid, in this case low-income people either in subsidized housing or trying to get into it.\n\"The whole continuum of housing is in crisis,\" said Tom Cooper, director of the Hamilton Roundtable for Poverty Reduction.\n\"People are getting on those waiting lists and not being able to get off them,\" said Cooper. \"Without the access to social housing, people are staying in some really rotten conditions, putting their health at risk, putting their safety at risk.\"\nIn the second part of this series, we look at the massive imbalance in the distribution of subsidized housing units between the city's poorer and richer areas that has led to a concentration of poverty in the inner city.\nThe third story will look at the deteriorating condition of city-owned subsidized housing units and the tens of millions of dollars in unbudgeted repairs needed just to keep existing apartments safe and livable.\nIn the final part, we look at the struggle nonprofit housing providers face in maintaining their current stock and building anew after years of declining government funding.\nHow did we get here?\nHamilton's housing crisis was born decades ago when several factors collided to create a perfect storm.\nIn the 1960s, rental apartment buildings sprouted like mushrooms across the province to accommodate the postwar baby boom. From 1962 to 1973, 60 per cent of all building permits issued in Canada were for multi-family dwellings.\nIn 1975, Ontario introduced rent control legislation, which coincided with the bottoming out of the rental construction market.\nRental construction starts went from 40,000 in 1972 to just a few thousand in 1975. By 1996, there were only 931 rental units built in the entire province.\nThat represented just two per cent of all housing units built that year, according to University of Toronto professor David Hulchanski. This came at a time when 36 per cent of Ontario households were renters.\nThrough the 1980s, single-family homes dominated the residential construction market, followed by a later boom in apartment condominiums and townhouses.\nNot long after, governments of various political stripes started getting out of the social housing business.\nIn 1993, the federal Liberal government withdrew funding for new social housing and later passed that responsibility down to provincial governments.\nA few years later, the provincial Tories under Mike Harris downloaded the cost and ownership of existing subsidized housing to local governments like Hamilton.\nIn more recent years, we've seen what Edward John calls the \"commodification\" of housing.\nA house - or a condo, or a townhouse - is no longer just a house. Home ownership has become an investment strategy and perhaps the easiest and most direct way for people to dramatically increase their net worth at a time when wages have remained relatively stagnant compared to inflation.\nIn the past decade, the average sale price of a Hamilton house doubled from $287,500 in 2008 to $575,500 in 2018. \"We have commodified housing and that has driven up the value of land,\" said John.\nReal-estate investment trusts, which are responsible to investors, have emerged as a force in recent years in Hamilton by buying up older apartment blocks. Some have been accused of evicting existing tenants to renovate and jack rents.\nTenants at Stoney Creek Towers, a highrise complex just east of Centennial Parkway, launched a rent strike last year to resist hikes tied to renovations.\nAt the same time, the rising cost of land has made it difficult for nonprofit corporations and charities to acquire property and build projects that can be affordable after years of government withdrawal from the sector.\n\"We cannot help the most vulnerable who are in the deepest need because you cannot make the numbers work,\" Lori-Anne Gagne, executive director of Victoria Park Community Homes in Hamilton.\nMeanwhile, the collapse of rental construction has had three outcomes - it has left a stock of older units, it has kept vacancy rates low because home ownership has become less attainable, and with supply and demand being what it is, it has caused rents to jump sharply.\nThe average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Hamilton went from $684 in 2009 to $1,240 this year.\nOn top of that, the ongoing gentrification of older, inner-city neighbourhoods by Greater Toronto Area ex-pats has had the potential of knocking more renters out of affordable units.\nAnd finally, construction costs for developers are rising rapidly, making it all the more difficult to build affordable housing.\nAccording to John, construction costs are increasing 10 to 20 per cent a year and a delay of six months can sometimes be fatal to a project.\nThe crisis in housing comes at a time when health and employment have become more precarious in Hamilton. It's not surprising the three are connected.\nEarlier this year, The Spectator's 10-year sequel to the original Code Red project showed that 10 of 13 health markers had worsened in Hamilton over the past decade.\nIn the last 10 years, there was nearly a 60 per cent jump in the proportion of psychiatric-related emergency room visits. More concerning, there were increases seen all across the city.\nA 2015 \nMcMaster University\n study showed that nearly 60 per cent of Hamilton's workers are employed in precarious jobs.\nNearly a quarter of Hamilton's millennials - those born between 1982 and 1997 - live with their parents, in part because they're being squeezed out of the housing market. A report this summer suggested it would now take 21 years of full-time work for a millennial in the GTA to save up enough money to purchase a home.\nMeanwhile, Hamilton's poverty rate has dropped only slightly between 2006 and 2016 and there remain vast differences in poverty rates between the inner city and the suburban communities.\nAccording to the last census, there are three inner-city neighbourhoods with poverty rates greater than 40 per cent and five suburban neighbourhoods with poverty rates less than two per cent.\nFinding ways to break concentrated poverty and improve the mix of incomes is essential, according to Jim Dunn, a McMaster University social sciences professor who studies housing, health and neighbourhoods.\n\"Concentrated poverty is quite bad for people,\" said Dunn. \"Over and above a person's socioeconomic status, there's an added risk and added harm that comes to them from living in concentrated poverty.\"\n\"In other words,\" Dunn said, \"being a low-income person in a mixed neighbourhood is better for your well-being than being a low-income person in a concentrated poverty neighbourhood.\"\nFinding a better way to mix incomes - indeed, just finding a way to build any more subsidized housing units - is going to be a tricky thing, Dunn said.\n\"The bottom line is that everybody for the last 25 to 30 years has been trying to do something with nothing.\"\nsbuist@thespec.com\n905-526-3226\ntmoro@thespec.com\n905-526-3264 | @TeviahMoro\nmvandongen@thespec.com\n905-526-3241 | @Mattatthespec\nPhotograph by John Rennison, The Hamilton Spectator"},
{"title": "Renters are seated at the kids table in this election", "date": "16 October 2019", "Journal": "Toronto Star", "author": "Tim Ross  Opinion", "wordscount": "815", "content": "If you've been following any of the federal leaders, the debates, or party platforms in this election, you would never know that housing is top of mind for Canadians.\nYet, over a quarter of Canadians would place housing affordability in their top three concerns, ahead of other high profile issues.\nIn five GTA ridings, a third of renters are spending more than half of their income on rent. In Willowdale, a riding where the crisis is at its peak, nearly 40 per cent of renters face this predicament.\nThe housing system is not working for Canadians. Millions lack decent, affordable housing, and upwards of 235,000 people experience homelessness every year. Despite this, the focus in the final stretch of the election has been on the dual citizenship and dual airplanes of the party leaders.\nDuring the leadership debates, we had an opportunity to discuss affordable housing with all six federal leaders in one place. Shockingly, during a question on affordability and household debt, none of the leaders talked about the high cost of housing.\nFor those wanting answers on housing, there was recently a national housing debate where key questions were put to the political parties on how they would address the housing crisis.\nLet's start with the good news. There was agreement between all parties that in a country as wealthy as Canada, no one should experience homelessness and that everyone deserves access to a safe, affordable place to call home.\nUnfortunately, there was less agreement between parties about the federal government's role in addressing the housing crisis.\n\nAdam Vaughan, the Liberal candidate for Spadina-Fort York, promoted the current government's national housing strategy. The Liberals seem content to stay the course on the rollout of their 2017 strategy to cut homelessness in half and remove 530,000 households from housing need over the next decade. Unfortunately, the jury is still out as to whether these targets are attainable with the limited dollars the Liberals put on the table, and their platform offers no hint of a course correction.\nConservative Pierre Poilievre's rhetorical prowess was in fine form as he stuck to a single message that government red tape and taxation are the principle constraints to the development of an adequate supply of housing for Canada's population. So far, the Conservatives have pledged support for first-time homebuyers, but there's been very little promised to help the millions of Canadians struggling to find and keep a decent place to rent. Planned cuts to infrastructure in the Conservative platform require greater scrutiny to ensure housing spending is not delayed or cut from future federal budgets.\nAngella MacEwen from the NDP seemed to strike a chord with the live audience in Ottawa when she said, \"I think we put too much emphasis on home ownership. Adults rent, and that's OK.\" Her party is promising to build 500,000 new units of affordable housing, while also providing immediate relief to low- and moderate-income renters through an income transfer of up to $5,000 per year for those struggling to pay their rent.\nBoth the Green and Bloc candidates agreed that Canadians cannot rely on the private market alone in order to solve the housing crisis. Bloc candidate Genevi\u00e8ve Nadeau highlighted how Qu\u00e9bec's Acc\u00e8sLogis program has continued to build a reliable supply of community and co-operative housing for low- and modest-income Quebecers.\nAs voters deliberated over their choices this Thanksgiving weekend, it is disappointing that the party leaders have relegated renters to the kids table. The crisis of supply and affordability in the housing market is not going away, and it will be up to the next federal government to lead sustainable and transformational initiatives in order to make the housing system work for everyone.\nIf good housing for all is indeed one of your top election priorities, you can urge candidates to support co-operative housing as a proven solution to the housing crisis. Today, a quarter of a million Canadians live in co-ops where members enjoy long-term affordability, security of tenure and stronger communities. Canadian co-ops have a 50-year track record, and have shown to be viable in rural, suburban and urban housing markets.\nAll federal parties can support new co-operative development by investing in the creation of new supply, while also setting aside surplus federal land to develop permanently affordable housing. In an election that is supposed to be about affordability, voters deserve more solutions to the housing crisis.\nTim Ross is executive director of the Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada."},

Prices in Montreal have been rising steadily during the past few years, and the momentum doesn't seem to be slowing.\nAccording to Royal Lepage's most recent House Price Survey, prices were up 5.9 per cent this fall over last year in Greater Montreal and seven per cent in the city centre.\nWhile that doesn't sound like much relative to the double-digit increases seen in Vancouver and Toronto in recent years, it's not chump change. The median price of a home in Montreal centre is now $532,026, which is $35,000 more than last year. In the Greater Montreal area, it's $418,731, a difference of $23,000.\nIn other words, if you've been putting off buying a house in the last year or so, you now could be paying tens of thousands more for the same type of property.\nFor many Montrealers, the logical solution is to look to the suburbs for cheaper housing. Not surprisingly, the exodus is now resulting in record sales and higher prices there, too. In Montreal East, prices in the third quarter of 2019 increased by 8.5 per cent year-over-year, and the price of two-storey homes in the region jumped 11.3 per cent.\nBuyers who are shopping beyond city limits aren't just looking at white-picket-fence properties, either. Sales of suburban condos are increasing, and prices are following. Laval posted the greatest increase in condo prices in the third quarter of 2019, at 6.8 per cent. Condo prices were also up by about five per cent in Montreal East and the South Shore.\nThere's still no major city in Canada with more affordable real estate than Montreal. Yet the steady rise in real estate prices is having a real impact on how much local buyers can afford.\nFederal and provincial governments are touting a range of potential solutions to help more Canadians become homeowners, but Dominic St-Pierre, director and vice-president at \nRoyal LePage\n Qu\u00e9bec, said these well-intentioned initiatives will only fuel even greater increases in house prices here in Montreal.\nStrong economic fundamentals are giving more Montrealers the confidence to buy or upgrade their homes, St-Pierre said, but the pool of available homes is rapidly shrinking, which is driving up prices. The number of properties for sale in the Greater Montreal region has been dropping for 48 consecutive months. In September, there were 21-per-cent fewer properties for sale compared with last year.\nOffering longer mortgage terms and financial incentives for first-time buyers will stimulate demand in a market that already has extremely low inventory, he pointed out.\nMore buyers vying for fewer houses for sale is not going to make housing more affordable in the long term.\n\"We really think they're looking at the wrong problem,\" St-Pierre said. \"The solution is construction.\"\nBut according to the APCHQ, an industry group representing the residential construction sector, although there was more residential construction in the first half of 2019 than we've seen in Quebec since 2010, more than half of the new housing units were rental apartments.\nIn Montreal, there were 44-per-cent fewer owner-occupancy homes under construction, and four-per-cent fewer condo units. Rental apartment construction, on the other hand, increased by 127 per cent.\nLooking ahead to the winter, \nRoyal LePage\n predicts Montreal real estate will outperform other major Canadian cities. Projections are that the year-over-year price increase in Montreal will remain at about six per cent, compared with 1.5 nationally.\nThe report anticipates an increase of three per cent in Toronto and a decrease of 5.5 per cent in Vancouver.\nDespite the gains in prices here in recent years, the aggregate price of a home in Canada is still 50-per-cent higher than in Montreal, according to the national price summary."},
{"title": "The case for a capital-gains tax on principal residences", "date": "15 October 2019", "Journal": "Toronto Star", "author": "Brianna Bell", "wordscount": "520", "content": "Last week my father-in-law forwarded me an email from Andrew Scheer's campaign, titled \u201cTrudeau's secret home tax.\u201d Within the forwarded email, dated Oct. 5, was a policy proposal drafted in November 2018 by Adam Vaughan, Liberal MP for Spadina-Fort York. The policy was an attempt at housing affordability and it proposed the option of a capital-gains tax on principal residences, which currently receive an exemption.\nI dug a bit deeper and discovered that the Conservatives have been talking about this secret tax since Sept. 12, when they tweeted out a similar allegation. Vaughan has already responded by saying the proposal was simply drafted after a town-hall meeting and quickly dismissed. It seems both the Conservatives and Liberals agree that a capital-gains tax on principal residences is a bad idea \u2014 however, I don't.\nIf you read Vaughan's document more thoroughly you'll discover that the capital gains tax was proposed on a sliding scale, where homeowners would be taxed up to 50 per cent if they lived in their home for one year or less before selling. By the time you've owned your home for over five years the tax drops to 5 per cent.\nWhile I agree that a 50 per cent capital gains tax is steep, the idea of taxing the capital gains of principal residences isn't terrible. If implemented, this could be a solid policy, especially if it targeted homeowners who own their homes for less than five years.\nI've been a resident of Guelph for the last six years and have been saving up for a home since I moved here with my husband and our infant daughter. Guelph was recently ranked as the second best city to purchase a home earlier this spring by \u201cMoneySense\u201d magazine; but even with home prices far more affordable than the GTA it has been a challenge to break into the market as a young family. In recent years Toronto buyers have been driving up the housing prices in picturesque Guelph, a 401 corridor city.\nA capital-gains tax on principal residences could be useful, especially if the tax was used to fund an effective incentive for first time home buyers. Homeowners who purchase residences for under five years and \u201cflip\u201d them for profit should be taxed on the money they profit \u2014 their gain is a loss for many Canadians trying to get into the market. Less house flipping for profit means fewer bidding wars and a more stable real estate market.\nWhoever suggested a capital-gains tax at Vaughan's town hall was onto something and it's too bad the Liberals didn't give the policy proposal a real chance. We need our government to make brave policy changes and while taxing capital gains might ruffle a few feathers, it will certainly lead to a better chance at affordable housing for struggling Canadians.\nBrianna Bell is a journalist whose work has been published in The \nNew York Times\n, The Globe & Mail, and CBC."},
{"title": "I'm a millennial hunting for a house in Vancouver. Follow my journey into the belly of the beast", "date": "13 October 2019", "Journal": "Toronto Star", "author": "Joanna Chiu", "wordscount": "1662", "content": "The Star Vancouver's Joanna Chiu is hunting for a home in Vancouver. Join her as she navigates one of the country's tightest real estate markets in a series of stories that will examine the challenges faced by a generation of prospective home buyers.\nVANCOUVER\u2014I lived overseas for most of the past decade, but every time I came home to Vancouver, it seemed like all everyone talked about was the soaring rents and housing prices.\nI overheard people squabbling over the reasons why, trying not to sound racist as the topic of wealthy newcomers came up, and bemoaning their increasingly long commutes as roads, buses and trains filled up with more and more humans.\nThat's why when I returned home last year, I didn't even try to hunt for a place. I took one look at \nCraigslist\n, spied the eye-watering rents (did they accidentally add an extra \u201c0\u201d to the listings?) and quickly accepted an offer from my parents to stay for $500 a month in a basement rental suite in a home they own in South Burnaby.\nIt was a steal, obviously, and my cat didn't mind it with all the juicy wolf spiders to catch. But after I got a job at the Star Vancouver newsroom, my daily trek downtown involved a 30-minute walk and one transfer in rush hour traffic for a total of more than two hours a day shuffling around instead of breaking news.\nAhead of the federal election[https://www.thestar.com/news/federal-election.html] on Oct. 21, candidates are making various promises about how they will address Metro Vancouver's housing crisis. As a journalist, I can say housing affordability is definitely top of mind for many voters here.\nIn Hong Kong, the most expensive housing market in the world, the average cost of a typical apartment in a new building is a staggering $2 million (Cdn). As a result, most people in Hong Kong live in truly tiny rentals, with the worst-off languishing in metal cages like rabbits, their enclosed bed-hutches stacked on top of another in filthy shared rooms.\nBut in Metro Vancouver, as high as housing prices have risen in the past decade, they haven't yet reached truly absurd stratospheric levels, and recent government cooling measures \u2014 such as the foreign-buyers' tax and mortgage stress tests \u2014 seemed to have nudged prices down. The latest numbers show a 5.2 per cent drop in prices for housing in the region, when comparing the summer of 2019 with the same three months last year.\nThis spring, I read a colleague's story about a developer offering a year's supply of avocado toast[https://www.thestar.com/vancouver/2019/04/24/how-to-sell-a-condo-to-millennials-in-vancouver-with-a-side-of-free-avocado-toast.html] to condo-buyers, and it got me thinking. Surely the market must be down if developers are desperate enough to bribe people with toast. Maybe owning a home close to downtown is possible for a hardworking, early-30s millennial like me.\nHowever, when I went through my housing wish list with my colleagues, everyone burst out laughing.\nI want a one bedroom in a new, pet-friendly building for under $500,000. It should be near a central skytrain station, have a parking space for visitors, a gym, a full kitchen with fancy countertops, and preferably an ocean or mountain view. My budget is far below Vancouver's benchmark apartment unit price of around $651,500.\nThe City of Vancouver also has the highest average monthly rent in Canada for a two-bedroom home ($2,915), and the fourth highest for one-bedrooms ($1,828), according to a recent report from Rentals.ca\nUndeterred, I found an experienced real estate agent, Hannah Horlings of Zolo Realty, who told me she was confident she could find me places that match as many of my criteria as possible. She wasn't expecting to contend with my parents and their feng shui expertise.\nI don't know about other communities, but in Chinese-Canadian households, you don't make decisions like home purchases without the blessing of your elders, who often conveniently insist on helping with the down payment.\n\u201cIt smells dead in here,\u201d my dad loudly whispered to me in Cantonese when we went for a showing in New Westminster. \u201cThere are jagged structures in the skyline that look like knives. Hard no.\u201d\nOf course, the listing agent understood Cantonese, and she blushed and averted her eyes while we debated.\n\u201cBut the foldaway murphy guest bed!\u201d I protested. \u201cAnd the pullout kitchen table that extends from the countertop! This is a whole lot of function for 420 square feet!\u201d\nThis summer, Hannah showed me a decent-sized place in a new development a few blocks away from the edge of Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, an area afflicted by poverty. I really liked the place \u2014 the communal garden even had a view of the Burrard Inlet. But this time, it was a male friend this time who vetoed my choice, saying it's still risky at night for a single woman.\n\u201cYou're going to get knifed.\u201d\n\u201cOK ...\u201d\nTo be clear, I have personally never felt unsafe in the Downtown Eastside and don't want to contribute to the stigmatizing of its residents. But my friend's comments drove it home that if I moved into a new development in the neighbourhood, I would be part of an ongoing gentrification process, and that would hang over my head.\nMonths into my search, home ownership seems further away than my daily commute to work, which is about to get a lot more pungent as winter sets in and everyone gets sausage-stuffed into train carriages with their wet raincoats and puffy jackets.\nEven if it proves impossible, maybe as a journalist I can at least learn something about our housing market from these efforts, as I keep searching for my dream home.\nBut as I sat down to write this story to chronicle what I learned, guilt set in that I have the fortune to even aspire to property ownership.\nVancouver has changed a lot, and changed quickly, with most people's salary increases not coming close to the surge in cost of living. Property ownership is far out of reach for most millennials in Vancouver, with the average price of a home about four times higher than what young prospective buyers could realistically afford to pay.\nSince I started my career overseas, even though rent was still high, my other daily costs were very low. I biked everywhere in Beijing, for example, and a delectable lunch could usually cost less than $5.\nI need to look more closely at my life and the other privileges I enjoy. My current monthly rent is $500, for Pete's sake.\nBecause my parents paid for my university education and covered my rent most of the time, too, I was able to save some of the money I made from part-time work as a student. Typically, immigrant parents tend to sacrifice a lot to make sure their children have everything they need to succeed. As a teenager, my parents forbade me from working at the mall. We weren't rich, but they still gave me spending money so I could focus on getting good grades.\nIt's true that later in our lives, Asian children are expected to spend a significant amount of time and money taking care of our parents in their old age, but when you can get such a great head start in life, it's just way easier than starting to invest later after paying off debts like student loans.\nI've always done the side hustles, too, taking on part-time gigs throughout my 20s. Chugging coffee, I often stayed up past midnight after already working long hours at my day job in order to squirrel away funds for travelling and investments.\nAnd taking on a mortgage would beat forking over thousands of dollars in rent each month to a landlord and helping them with their sky-high mortgages.\nEarlier this week, I phoned my friend Amanda Reaume, a financial writer and author of books for younger readers like, The Complete Guide to a Debt-Free Education.\nI told her about my increasing ambivalence about home ownership, and she told me it was very common for people to feel guilty about wanting to make money, invest and acquire assets, particularly in a place like Vancouver, which has a high level of income inequality.\nBut she reminded me that \u201cwealth is something that can be used as a tool. It can be used to enrich only yourself and your immediate family or leveraged as a tool to make a greater impact for the community and causes you care about later on.\n\u201cThere's nothing about money \u2014 or having it or not having it \u2014 that makes you good or bad.\u201d\nThanks for joining me on my odyssey through the overpriced homes of Vancouver. Future topics may include my puzzlement over the term \u201cjunior one-bedroom,\u201d the collective \u201clifestyle creep\u201d that Vancouverites have experienced and examinations of the different ways that young tenants and homeowners get raw deals when trying to find their dream homes.\nI will also travel to B.C.'s interior to visit my friends who have given up on Vancouver to settle down in smaller towns, taunting me with their beautiful fireplaces and actual front and backyards.\nAnd, if you have tips on where I can find a fantastic pad at rock-bottom prices, let me know!\nJoanna Chiu is a senior reporter for Star Vancouver covering both Canada-China relations and current affairs on the West Coast.

The benchmark price for a resale home fell about two per cent in September compared with the same month last year. Year to date, ending Sept. 30, prices were down almost four per cent compared with the same span in 2018.\nFalling prices tend to spur more sales activity, particularly in the lower end of the market, Lurie says.\n\"As prices come down enough that supports demand growth.\"\nAll told, sales rose by more than eight per cent in September, year over year.\nAt the same time, falling prices reduce new listings as would-be sellers hold off putting their homes on the market, Lurie adds. Consequently, new listings fell 12 per cent in September from the same period the year before, while supply fell 20 per cent.\nApartment sales led the way with a 16 per cent surge month over month, although apartment sales are up only slightly year to date.\n\"Some of that (sales growth) is due to the really affordable product on the market,\" Lurie says.\nWhile the bulk of sales remains in the $200,000 to $299,000 range, year to date sales ending in September for apartments under $200,000 grew for the fourth year in a row - making it unique among all style and price segments.\n\"It really is a consistent story that most of the push is from the most affordable product.\"\nWhat's more, Lurie adds sales in the under $200,000 price range were virtually unheard of at the peak of the market in 2014. This more recent development is largely driven by a price decline in the apartment segment of 17 per cent from the peak five years ago.\nStill, the market is moving toward balance even though Calgary real estate still favours buyers.\nLurie says economics must improve before the market gets significantly better for sellers. While employment has improved, much of the job creation has not been in high-paying energy and related industries, she says. Still, unemployment was down in August at 7.3 per cent from eight per cent in August 2018. As well, migration was up year over year ending in July, with more than 5,500 people coming to the province. But that's a far cry from the high point in 2014 when the city had net population gain of almost 12,500 people.\n\"Overall, the trend is toward more balanced conditions,\" Lurie says. \"But we're still not there yet.\""},

This is impacting housing demand, particularly in areas like Red Deer,\" says Lurie. \"Meanwhile, some markets are facing challenges with supply gains, impacting pricing.\n\"The provincial figures are heavily influenced by the larger regions, which are starting to trend toward more stable conditions, but these improvements are not occurring across all regions of the province.\"\nHere are Lurie's overviews of the province's two largest cities.\nCalgary With gains in the lower price range, sales activity in the region improved in September compared to a year ago. The improvements in sales are helping the market return to more balanced conditions, but the more significant shifts have been related to the supply adjustments.\nYear-to-date new listings are down by 11 percent this year, compared to the less than one percent growth in sales, year over year. The combined impact is inventory declines and improvements in market balance as months of inventory has shifted from more than six months last September to slightly more than five months this year. As oversupply in the market eases, there is less downward pressure on prices. However, year-to-date average prices remain more than four percent lower than last year's levels.\nEdmonton September sales activity improved over last year's levels and were just below long-term trends. Year-to-date sales are comparable to last year, but there has been a shift in the type of product sold. Sales activity has improved for product priced below $300,000, which represents 35 percent of all sales. Sales have eased across all other price ranges.\nWhile new listings in September remained stable compared to last year, for much of the year new listings has eased, reacting to weaker demand levels and easing prices.

{"title": "Why the Liberal plan to tame house prices is actually a tax grab from Toronto and Vancouver", "date": "12 October 2019", "Journal": "Toronto Star", "author": "Peter Shawn Taylor", "wordscount": "784", "content": "Federal elections always feel a bit like Christmas from a municipal point of view, as party leaders try to prove how much they care about local issues with sacks full of policy gifts.\nOur current campaign is certainly no exception. The federal Liberal platform, for example, makes new promises to Toronto on everything from money for electric school buses to banning handguns to fighting gangs.\nYet hidden away among these Liberal election goodies is a little-noticed package that ought to elicit shudders of fear from city halls. If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wins on Oct. 21, one of the most important and sacrosanct sources of municipal revenue could come under direct assault by Ottawa.\n\u201cWe will \u2026 [apply] a one per cent annual vacancy and speculation tax on applicable residential properties owned by non-resident, non-Canadians,\u201d the Liberal platform declares, promising what amounts to the beginnings of a federal property tax. This concrete proposal is not to be confused with a controversial capital gains tax on home flippers contained in a 2018 Liberal caucus memo since disavowed by the party and its author, Toronto-area Liberal MP Adam Vaughan. This is an entirely separate \u2014 and equally bad \u2014 idea.\nThe Liberals' one per cent a year federal property tax is meant to scare off foreign buyers of Canadian real estate and thus tame prices. It's hardly a novel idea. Both Ontario and British Columbia, home to the two priciest housing markets in Canada, already have similar taxes doing the same thing.\nAcross the Greater Golden Horseshoe, Ontario's Non-Resident Speculation Tax levies a 15 per cent tax on real estate purchases by non-residents of Canada. It collected $181 million last year, although its impact on real estate prices remains highly debatable. The same is true with B.C.'s Speculation and Vacancy Tax, which hits foreigners with an annual two per cent annual property tax, and raised $115 million last fiscal year.\nTo the extent home prices in Toronto or Vancouver can be moderated by a tax on foreign buyers, the provinces \u2014 which have jurisdiction in this area \u2014 are already doing plenty. An additional one per cent for Ottawa just piles on existing efforts without any co-ordination or consultation.\nPlus, outside Canada's two biggest metropolitan areas, foreign speculation is not a real concern. Actively trying to discourage non-residents from buying homes in Atlantic Canada, for example, will do those provinces real harm. So why bother?\n\u201cThis is not a good idea,\u201d says tax expert Jack Mintz. \u201cHousing markets are quite local but the federal government by necessity has a one-size-fits-all national approach.\u201d Mintz is the Presidents Fellow at the University of Calgary's School of Policy Studies and author of numerous reports on taxation and competitiveness.\nMintz points out a federal property tax would also require Ottawa to piggyback on municipal and provincial assessment systems, since it lacks its own national database to track property values. But since methodologies vary significantly across jurisdictions, knitting all this data into one catalogue will inevitably create problems of unfairness on a national scale. The buyers' tax could also pose an obstacle to recruiting high-priced foreign talent to Toronto's globally competitive high tech and entertainment sectors.\nMintz's biggest concern, however, is the precedent an incipient federal property tax will set. \u201cThis has never been the federal government's tax area,\u201d he points out. Property tax is far and away the dominant source of municipal revenue. Allowing a higher level of government to squeeze its way into even a portion of this revenue stream poses a major threat to the security of future municipal finances. Keep in mind, the $200 million to $300 million this new federal tax is expected to earn will mostly come out of Toronto and Vancouver. That's money those cities can't earn.\nAnd once Ottawa creates the infrastructure necessary for assessing and taxing property values nation-wide, why stop at foreign speculators? The real risk here lies in the federal government realizing this new tax could become a reliable and convenient way to get at the vast asset base held by Canadians homeowners. After all, when did Ottawa meet a new tax it didn't love forever?\nPeter Shawn Taylor is a freelance writer and editor based in Waterloo."},

I've never bought property before - what should I do to get started?\nCongratulations! Buying your first home is an exciting milestone.\nIt is also an endeavour that can get complicated quickly, so I recommend working with a registered real estate salesperson or broker to guide you through the process.\nThe Real Estate Council of Ontario (RECO) has been looking out for home buyers - and sellers - for more than two decades. Start your home search at RECO's website and follow these five steps:\n1) Research registered real estate salespeople to find the one who is right for you.\n2) Use our Real Estate Professional Search tool on the website to ensure the individuals you're considering are registered and in good standing.\n3) Think carefully about your needs and your finances, and communicate that information to the sales rep you choose.\n4) Read and completely understand any documents you're asked to sign.\n5)Be an active participant in the process. Remember: you're in the driver's seat, so don't make a decision unless you are well-informed and comfortable with it.\nReal estate salespeople and brokers offer different approaches to buying, and the services they provide. Keep in mind that salespeople and brokers are legally required to be registered with RECO to trade real estate in Ontario.\nIf a salesperson presents you with a Buyer Representation Agreement (BRA), ask them to walk you through it, line by line.\nYou may also want to have a real estate lawyer review it before you sign. I strongly recommend that consumers work with both a registered salesperson or broker and a real estate lawyer throughout the process. Each offers valuable expertise.\nYour financial situation will directly determine your options for your first home purchase, so talk to your lender about getting pre-approved for a mortgage. You will have to put down a deposit, a down payment, pay closing costs and possibly mortgage insurance. There are also other fees to consider - such as moving expenses and legal fees.\nThink about what type of property you want, and how your purchase will impact your lifestyle. Do you want a detached, or semi-detached home for a growing family? Or are you looking to start with a smaller place, like a townhome or a condo?\nDo you want something low-maintenance, or are you prepared to take on a property that requires more attention? This could include anything from lawn care through to major renovations and repairs.\nAlso consider how long you plan to stay in your first property.\nYou need to think about all of these factors and share your preferences with your salesperson or broker. Your real estate rep can best help you when you're open and honest with them. Doing so will help you to find your perfect \"for-now\" home - or perhaps even your dream \"forever\" home.\nBest of luck in your search.\nIf you have a question about the home buying or selling process, please email information@reco.on.ca.\nJoe Richer is registrar of the Real Estate Council of Ontario (RECO) and contributor for the Star.

{"title": "September surge may be sign housing is finally returning to long-term equilibrium; Murtaza Haider and Stephen Moranis examine factors behind the recovery in sales in both Toronto and Vancouver", "date": "11 October 2019", "Journal": "Edmonton Journal", "author": "Murtaza Haider and Stephen Moranis", "wordscount": "811", "content": "Housing markets in Toronto and Vancouver appear to be on the mend, as both gained strength over the summer and have posted a record increase in sales in the fall.\nSeptember housing sales in greater Vancouver increased by 46.3 per cent from the same month last year. A similar story emerged in greater Toronto where the September 2019 sales were 22-per-cent higher than the sales recorded a year earlier.\nWhile sales in September were up in both Toronto and Vancouver, housing prices presented a different picture. The MLS composite home price index, which captures the price of a typical dwelling over time, was up by 5.2 per cent on an annual basis in Toronto. In comparison, the index was down by 7.3 per cent in Vancouver.\nWhile the industry has greeted the rebound with relief, the question of why sales are bouncing back now is unclear.\nSome experts believe that low mortgage rates have been a factor. Also, buyers previously deterred by the stress tests might \"have adjusted to the guideline in terms of the type and location of purchase, purchase price and down payment amount,\" according to Jason Mercer, chief market analyst for the Toronto Real Estate Board.\nOthers believe that shared equity mortgages (SEM) might have contributed to the increase in sales. SEMs, which became effective in September, provide up to 10 per cent of the purchase price to a first-time homebuyer in exchange for an equity stake in the property. Proponents believe that SEMs help reduce monthly mortgage payments, which may induce housing demand by firsttime homebuyers.\nWhile the theory seems plausible, we believe SEMs are an unlikely catalyst. SEMs come with certain conditions.\nFor one, the qualifying properties must be priced under $500,000 - a category that actually saw a five-per-cent decline in sales in Toronto on a year-overyear basis.\nThe more substantial increase in sales was observed for rather expensive properties in Toronto. September 2019 sales of homes priced between $1.25 million and $1.75 million increased by more than 50 per cent on an annual basis, while those of homes priced between $900,000 and $1.25 million jumped by more than 40 per cent.\nTsur Somerville, a professor of real estate finance at the University of British Columbia, noted an uptick in sales over the summer. Houses in Vancouver's high-demand neighbourhoods were \"moving very quickly,\" he said.\nSomerville pointed out that the last month's jump in sales in Vancouver comes following a down period in September 2018, when sales relative to the year before had collapsed by 43.5 per cent. The Vancouver market, in other words, is trying to regain what it had lost over the past couple of years.\nWhat is interesting about the sudden resurgence in sales in both Toronto and Vancouver is that it occurred during a period of strong \"underlying economic fundamentals that have not changed much,\" Somerville said.\nSome experts believe that the converging prices of semi-detached units, condominium apartments, and townhouses in cities such as Toronto are indicative of markets approaching an equilibrium. Benjamin Tal, the deputy chief economist with CIBC World Markets, believes that the correction in low-rise housing is finally over. The pent-up demand in Toronto has brought the buyers from the sidelines resulting in an acceleration in sales and prices.\nHousing markets have arrived back at a point \"where we should have been,\" said Tal.\nThe evidence that markets are returning to their long-term equilibrium is indeed getting stronger. September 2019 sales in Toronto, at 7,825 units, are similar to the sales recorded in September 2014 and 2015. At the same time, housing prices in Toronto, despite the earlier decline in sales volume, have been resilient over the past five years.\nLike other economists, Tal also believes that declining interest rates have helped the recovery in housing markets. However, he cautions the markets to be prepared for an interest rate hike in 2020 or soon afterwards. Financial Post Murtaza Haider is a professor of Real Estate Management at \nRyerson University\n.

But as a testament to the balanced real estate market in Winnipeg, the actual number of sales continued to be brisk.\nThe housing market is dynamic with all sorts of different pressure points, but many industry experts agree that one of the factors influencing the Winnipeg market these days is the increasing number of new rental housing units.\nArtis REIT is building one of the city's largest apartment buildings: a 40-storey, 400-unit building just south of 360 Main, its Portage and Main office tower. Even though it is about one year behind its original construction schedule, due to trade tariffs that disrupted international steel markets, its third-quarter 2021 opening date will likely single-handedly raise the city's apartment vacancy rate, which now sits at about 2.9 per cent.\nFrank Sherlock, executive vice-president of property management with Artis REIT, said, \u201cVacancy rates are very low in Winnipeg now and will probably continue to stay fairly low. For us, the thinking is, are we going to be able to convince people to live downtown?\"\nSherlock is not overconfident, but he does believe more people are opening up to the idea.\nFrank Koch-Schulte, vice-president at Edison Properties, one of the three largest residential property managers in the city, says there's no doubt that's happening.\n\u201cWhen it comes to downtown, it seems like everyone (is) trying to jump on board the downtown market,\" he said. \u201cIt seems like every large (apartment development) company has something at various stages of development.\"\nEdison Properties \u2014 no stranger to the downtown housing rental market, having built and run the 30-year-old Fort Garry Place \u2014 is in the process of renovating a former Manitoba Housing building on Smith Street.\n\u201cThere is definitely a lot going on (in the rental housing development scene),\" Koch-Schulte said.\nDemand for rentals is definitely up and there are developments across the city, including a significant number of new units near the \nUniversity of Manitoba\n's Fort Garry campus, to alleviate a shortage of appropriate student housing.\nKoch-Schulte said Winnipeg is becoming more attractive for developers from outside the province.\n\u201cIt's a good thing for the average tenant because (an increasing number of units on the market) puts downward pressure on prices,\" he said.\n\u201cWinnipeg has been overlooked in the past, but now we see developers from Edmonton and Calgary... who have been forced to look elsewhere for growth.\"\nThe steady increase in the number of apartment units coming onto the market is one factor in the steady decline in housing starts in Winnipeg in recent months, according to \nCanada Mortgage and Housing Corp\n.\nWith lots of new rental inventory and a backlog of resale homes on the market, homebuilders are dialing it back.\nChristian Arkilley, a senior economics analyst with CMHC, said there is strong demand in Winnipeg for rental apartments for a couple of reasons.\n\u201cOne is affordability,\" he said. \u201cThe other is the increase in the number of international immigrants to Winnipeg. Typically, their first introduction to the housing market is on the rental side.\"\nPeter Squire, vice-president of external relations and market intelligence with the Winnipeg Realtors Association, said the increase in the rental housing option adds to the functionality of what is widely regarded as a very balanced real estate market that Winnipeg currently boasts.\n\u201cWe had such a shortage of rental housing in the first decade of the century that helped cause double-digit single-family home price increases,\" he said. \u201cThe extra supply of rental has helped to calm the market down considerably. It's made the market competitive for all property types.\"\nThere were 1,211 homes sold in Winnipeg in September \u2014 16 per cent more than last year \u2014 but prices were fairly flat.\nWhile there are brisk sales, the actual listings \u2014 the number of houses that are on the market \u2014 were up 10 per cent.\nSquire said there are now enough listings on the market to account for about five months' worth of sales.\nThat dynamic is not all about new apartment units on the market, but it is a contributing factor.\nSo far this year, 2,642 new rental units have emerged on the market, CMHC reported.\nLast year, there were 3,510 new rental units out of a total of 5,384 housing starts in Winnipeg.\nmartin.cash@freepress.mb.ca"},

New condos were $840,799 during the same period.\nThis year to date, there have been 23,949 housing starts in the Toronto area, compared to 30,078 last year, said CMHC.

{"title": "Growing construction costs a factor in housing affordability; That's why hiking supply won't be enough, Murtaza Haider and Stephen Moranis write", "date": "5 October 2019", "Journal": "Vancouver Sun", "author": "Stephen Moranis", "wordscount": "863", "content": "The prices of high-and low-rise condominiums have been converging recently in Toronto.\nSince highrise condominiums are often smaller, their prices tend to be lower, but the gap has been shrinking since 2017 primarily because of the increase in highrise construction costs.\nRising housing prices are often attributed to higher demand for housing or the unwelcome influence of speculation, foreign investors and even money laundering. However, the price of newly built units is also sensitive to construction costs.\n\n\nStatistics Canada\n produces a quarterly construction price index that accounts for what the contractors charge for labour, materials, overhead and profit. Excluded from the index are taxes, land costs, design and real estate fees.\n\"Prices charged by contractors for residential (+2.7 per cent) and non-residential (+3.9 per cent) building construction were up over the 12-month period ending in the second quarter\" of 2019, the agency reported.\nConstruction cost increases are not uniform across the country. At 5.2 per cent, Ottawa recorded the highest increase in residential construction costs year-overyear. In Vancouver, residential construction costs were up by 4.8 per cent.\nResearch in the U.S. has shown that labour costs vary much more than material costs across cities. In New York City, labour costs were 31.3 per cent higher than the average for the 30 largest cities. Similarly, labour costs were 25.6 per cent higher in San Francisco and 16.8 per cent higher in Chicago. This makes construction even more expensive in large and dense cities.\nTwo factors contributed to the closing price gap between low-and highrise units. First, the increase in low-rise housing prices slowed in 2017. Second, construction costs of highrise housing increased significantly.\nIn addition to the increase in material costs, changes in labour costs also affect new home prices.\nIn times of labour scarcity, wages rise more sharply. Some trades, such as tower crane operators and elevator constructors and mechanics, are more sensitive to labour shortages because of a lack of certified workers.\nResidential builders must presell a large proportion of planned units to qualify for construction financing. Builders sign contracts with buyers who submit deposits against a predetermined price to be paid in full when units are ready for occupancy. This commits builders and buyers to a fixed price.\nFor projects still in the planning stage, an unexpected increase in construction costs, resulting from labour, materials or delays due to regulation, forces builders to decide whether to continue or abandon the project. Because the price of the units is already fixed and is not sensitive to changes in construction costs, an increase in costs can adversely impact the feasibility of a residential project.\nWhen cost increases are substantial, builders may opt to cancel the project. Such cancellations could hurt a builder's reputation and also impose considerable inconvenience on buyers whose purchasing power will be eroded by rising house prices.\nHard construction costs come on top of land costs, which also contribute to the overall cost of construction, and can be substantial.\nAltus Group's estimates suggest that for high-density residential developments in Vancouver, for instance, land cost (as a function of the buildable area) ranges from below $100 per square foot to over $300 per square foot.\nThus, to build a 100,000 square-foot high-density residential building in Vancouver, land costs could vary from under $10 million to over $30 million. By comparison, land costs for a similar-sized building will range from $2.5 million to $4.5 million in Calgary and from $50 million to $225 million in Toronto.\nHard construction costs - exclusive of land costs, fees, and taxes - do not differ as widely as land prices. According to Altus Group, hard construction costs for a 40-to 60-storey condominium building range between $215 and $280 per square foot in Vancouver and between $200 and $260 per square foot in Calgary and Toronto.\nThus, scapegoating unbridled demand, speculation, foreign buyers and money launderers for house price inflation may not be the right societal or policy response. We have argued that housing affordability could best be addressed by increasing housing supply. However, if construction costs are rising, supply alone will not be sufficient to provide immediate relief from house price escalation.\nConcerted efforts to moderate material and labour costs and streamlining regulations will also be needed in the mix of strategies to improve housing affordability.

{"title": "Ottawa real estate market shows hints of cooling, September data reveals", "date": "5 October 2019", "Journal": "Ottawa Citizen", "author": "James Bagnall", "wordscount": "732", "content": "Maybe, just maybe, a slight cooling of Ottawa's housing market is at hand.\nThe average resale price for residential properties in September climbed 8.3 per cent year over year to $487,400 according to data published Wednesday by the Ottawa Real Estate Board. While that's still discouraging for people trying to save for a down payment on their first house, it marks the first time in four months that year over year percentage hikes have been in the single digits.\nDespite the relatively low inventories - fewer than 2,800 resale homes were listed at the end of September, down 20 per cent from a year earlier - real estate agents managed to sell more than 1,100 properties during the month, eight per cent more than in September 2018. This was something of a surprise because Ottawa real estate activity normally slows in the runup to a federal election.\n\"We haven't seen that transpire this year,\" said board president Dwight Delahunt. \"It suggests consumers are highly confident in our local economy and real estate market.\"\nIndeed, Ottawa's condo market remains very active. The average sale price in September was $309,400, up 9.1 per cent year over year, marking the first time since January that condo price increases topped those of residential properties. Realtors associated with the Ottawa board sold 436 condos in September, a sharp 26-per-cent rise from a year earlier. There were fewer than 600 condos listed at the end of the month, down 40 per cent from September 2018.\nThe biggest price gains for condos were recorded in the downtown core where units sold for an average $438,000, up 14.5 per cent year over year.\nSellers of condos in the east end also registered double-digit gains, producing an average price of $301,000, while condo prices in the west end weakened marginally. The average sale price in the west end in September was $320,000.\nDrilling down to the board's nearly 50 real estate districts produces a few surprises but many of these can be explained by statistical anomalies. For instance, the five districts that reported the biggest year over year jumps in average residential prices were heavily influenced by the sale of one or two monster homes combined with low sales volume. For instance, the district that encompasses Country Place, Pineglen and Crestview saw the unusual sale last month of a $1.2 million property - one of just four resales - helping to produce a dramatic year over year increase of 34 per cent for the district. But strip away the unusual item, and the average price gain for the remaining three houses was a more moderate 11 per cent, producing an average sale price of $663,000.\nThe same pattern applied in reverse for districts such as Rockcliffe Park and the Glebe, where the average residential property sold for 38-per-cent and 20-percent less respectively than a year earlier. This produced an average of $1.7 million for the two houses sold last month in Rockcliffe and $753,000 for the 14 properties sold in the Glebe, where results were skewed by the sale a year earlier of at least five multi-million dollar properties.\nThe best barometer of how Ottawa real estate is doing can generally be found in the four districts that consistently report the largest number of sales each month. Orleans-Cumberland, Kanata, Barrhaven and the Richmond area together accounted for 35 per cent of the city's house sales last month. In Kanata, where 109 homes were sold last month, the average price climbed 18.6 per cent year over year to $528,125, while the other three districts saw price gains more in line with the citywide trend.

Edmonton's benchmark price is $321,300 with a median income of $94,447.\n\"Based on that you would quality for a maximum mortgage amount of $317,344,\" Graham says.\nTo save up for the down payment of about $16,000, it would take a would-be buyer about a year saving 20 per cent of his or her pre-tax income.\n\"That is very feasible for many homebuyers.\"\nRanking sixth, Calgary had a benchmark house price of $420,500 and a median household income before tax of $99,583.\nThis would qualify the median buyer for a $415,454 mortgage. If that buyer saved 20 per cent of household income, it would also take one year to save five per cent of the home price for a down payment of about $21,000.\nWhile the majority of cities surveyed are considered affordable, seven were not.\nThese include Greater Vancouver, Greater Toronto, Victoria, the Fraser Valley, Hamilton-Burlington, Kitchener-Waterloo and London and St. Thomas.\n\"This is where we get into the median household income and what you would need to purchase the benchmark home price having a disparity between the two that is getting really, really wide,\" she says.\nGreater Vancouver topped the list as the least affordable market. The benchmark price there is $993,300.\n\"And then the median income in Greater Vancouver ($72,652) is actually lower than in some of these Prairie provinces,\" Graham says.\nThat means individuals with this income can only qualify for a $241,994 mortgage.\n\"If you were going to complete this deal, you would have to come up with $751,306 as the down payment.\"\nThat's 76 per cent of the total price.\n\"That's obviously not a realistic scenario for a homebuyer.\"\nBased on saving 20 per cent of income a year for a five per cent down payment, it would take the average buyer there 52 years to buy the benchmark priced home.\nIn the Fraser Valley, the second least affordable market, buyers would need to save for 42 years.\nAnd in Greater Toronto, it would take buyers 32 years to save.\nOverall, the benchmark price average across all cities was $627,400 with a median income of $70,336, qualifying for a mortgage of $280,703. That's enough to cover 55 per cent of the price, which means the median buyer would have to save 20 per cent of income for 25 years for a five per cent down payment."},
{"title": "Canada's housing market is roaring back with black-tie condo launches", "date": "4 October 2019", "Journal": "Hamilton Spectator", "author": "", "wordscount": "951", "content": "TORONTO - More than a thousand brokers and agents sipped wine and nibbled ahi tuna hors d'oeuvres at the black-tie sales launch of a luxury condominium in downtown Toronto last month.\nThe proposed 62-storey skyscraper in Yorkville, one of Canada's most exclusive neighbourhoods, features black marble kitchens with built-in wine troughs, an indoor-outdoor infinity pool and a piano lounge. Units range from about $650,000 to almost $1.97 million for a 1,163-square-foot, three-bedroom suite. Add in parking for $169,000.\n\"They're selling out like crazy,\" said Dawna Borg, a broker at Re/Max Premier Inc., who spent more than three hours at the sales office one Saturday trying to snag units for her clients. \"We had to go back Sunday and just wait for a new allocation to come out, and we still didn't 100 per cent get what we wanted.\"\nA spokesperson for RioCan REIT, which is developing the building with Metropia and Capital Developments, said more than 70 per cent of the units have been sold since the mid-September launch.\nCanada's housing market is back with a roar this fall. Benchmark prices in Toronto jumped 5.2 per cent to $805,500 in September from a year earlier, only about $10,000 below their peak two years ago. While prices in Vancouver continue to fall, sales rebounded 46 per cent, the third month in a row of year-on-year gains. Montreal and Ottawa continue to chug along and even in beleaguered Calgary, the energy capital of Canada, sales rose 8.2 per cent in September from last year.\nIn contrast, the housing market is sobering up in Manhattan, as resale prices for condos and co-ops dropped 8 per cent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the biggest drop since 2012.\nNew regulations in Canada, including stricter mortgage criteria and tax increases to cool foreign purchases, helped stem runaway price gains through 2018.\nThose appear to have been largely absorbed - aided by the global drop in borrowing rates, record immigration and a strong labour market.\nAll of those factors have put housing affordability front and centre in the federal election campaign.\n\"I worked 90 hours in one week,\" said Simeon Papailias, co-founder of the Real Estate Center, a real estate management company. He sold 30 condos in one weekend. \"The presale market is on fire again, but resale has picked up too: We're having the best back-to-back month since 2017.\"\nCanada's population rose 531,497 to 37.6 million in July, the biggest year-over-year increase in records going back to the 1970s, according to the federal statistics agency. Many are ending up in Toronto's booming tech and financial-services sector or attending the city's many universities and colleges.\nSupply is lagging demand with even the \nInternational Monetary Fund\n this week urging Canada to ease a thicket of red tape constraining construction such as permitting and zoning delays. Government-related fees on new Toronto homes are among the highest in North America, according to an industry group, which can add almost $223,000 to the cost of a new detached home.\n\"The demand side of the equation is incredibly strong and the supply side is a puzzle that has not been figured out by anybody,\" said Sasha Cucuz, a partner at \nGreybrook Capital\n, a private-equity firm with a North American real estate portfolio valued at more than $15 billion, including projects underway. \"When you couple those together, that's an indisputable upward pressure on pricing, flat out, whether it's rental or housing.\"\nBoth the Liberal and Conservative parties are on the campaign trail promising to make home buying more affordable. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau is pledging to boost the cap on homes eligible for a 10 per cent government-equity stake to almost $800,000 in costly markets like Vancouver and Toronto. The Conservatives plan to extend mortgage amortizations and review the mortgage stress test for first-time buyers and remove it from mortgage renewals.\nThough the fall housing market has kicked off with several big condo launches, the buying period before the election will still be a bit iffy, Borg, the Re/Max broker, said.\n\"No one really knows what to expect: Who's going to be in power? Are there going to be new rules? Because they really need to revisit that stress test - it's causing people a lot of stress,\" Borg said.\nLofty home prices have pushed many prospective buyers into the rental market, where vacancy rates are at historically low levels and rents continue to rise.\n\"Despite purpose-built apartment construction rising fourfold since 2014, rental supply is unlikely to come close to demand in the coming years,\" Robert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said in a report last month. \"A deliberate policy to boost rental supply is needed - with specific targets and incentives to achieve them.\"\nThe bank estimates that the number of renter households will jump by an average of 22,200 per year in Toronto. To restore equilibrium over a two-year time frame, Toronto would have to add an average of 26,800 units per year.\nThe federal government housing agency has ramped up incentives for new rental development, including a rental-financing initiative, but projected rental supply falls short of what's needed and needs to at least double, Hogue said."},
